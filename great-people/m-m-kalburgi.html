                                        <div><p>M. M. Kalburgi, also known as Malleshappa Madivalappa Kalburgi, was an eminent Indian scholar, writer, academic, and former Vice-Chancellor of Kannada University in Hampi, Karnataka. A highly respected figure in Kannada literature and scholarship, he was known for his progressive ideas, especially in the areas of religion and culture. Kalburgi&#39;s outspoken criticism of religious orthodoxy and his scholarly works on the Lingayat community made him a prominent but controversial figure, ultimately leading to tragic consequences.</p>  <h2>1. Early Life and Education</h2>  <ul> <li><strong>Birth</strong>: M. M. Kalburgi was born on November 28, 1938, in Yaragal, a village in the Bijapur district (now Vijayapura) of Karnataka, India.</li> <li><strong>Education</strong>: Kalburgi pursued his early education in Karnataka and later specialized in Kannada literature, earning his degrees from Karnataka University in Dharwad.</li> <li>Kalburgi&rsquo;s academic training laid the foundation for his later work as a scholar, writer, and critic, with a particular focus on Kannada literature and the Vachana (poetry) movement in the Lingayat community.</li> </ul>  <h2>2. Academic and Literary Career</h2>  <ul> <li>Kalburgi began his career as an academic, teaching Kannada at Karnataka University in Dharwad, where he gained recognition for his research and writings on ancient Kannada literature.</li> <li>He later became the <strong>Vice-Chancellor of Kannada University in Hampi</strong>, where he contributed significantly to the study and promotion of Kannada language and literature.</li> <li>Known for his deep engagement with Kannada literary heritage, Kalburgi authored over 20 books and hundreds of research papers, mostly focused on the history, culture, and literature of Karnataka, as well as the Lingayat tradition.</li> </ul>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-1'> <p>Google Ad 1</p> </div>  <h2>3. Contributions to Kannada Literature</h2>  <ul> <li>Kalburgi was a leading scholar of <strong>Vachana Sahitya</strong>, the Kannada poetic tradition associated with the 12th-century reformer Basava and the Lingayat community.</li> <li>His critical work on Vachana literature explored themes of social equality, spirituality, and reform.</li> <li>His research provided insights into the <strong>Veerashaiva-Lingayat movement</strong>, which promoted social justice, opposed caste hierarchy, and encouraged personal devotion over ritualistic practices.</li> <li>Kalburgi also contributed to Kannada literary criticism and the interpretation of ancient Kannada texts, examining the cultural and social contexts that shaped Kannada literature.</li> <li>His book <strong>&quot;Marga&quot;</strong>, a collection of essays and critiques on various literary and religious subjects, is one of his most well-known works.</li> <li>It delves into different aspects of Kannada literature, with a particular emphasis on dissenting and reformist traditions.</li> </ul>  <h2>4. Views on Religion and Social Reform</h2>  <ul> <li>Kalburgi was a strong proponent of rationalism and secularism, which reflected in his scholarly work and public statements.</li> <li>He was an outspoken critic of religious orthodoxy and frequently challenged conservative interpretations of the Lingayat faith.</li> <li>He argued that the Lingayat tradition, which he regarded as distinct from Hinduism, should be recognized as a separate religion.</li> <li>Kalburgi also took controversial positions on <strong>idol worship and superstition</strong>, which were met with hostility from some religious groups.</li> <li>His criticism of practices he viewed as regressive or contrary to the teachings of Basava, the founder of the Lingayat movement, sparked considerable opposition.</li> <li>His views, though controversial, were part of a larger intellectual tradition in Karnataka that questioned orthodoxy and advocated for social reform.</li> </ul>  <h2>5. Controversies and Opposition</h2>  <ul> <li>Kalburgi&#39;s research and outspoken views on religion, especially within the Lingayat community, attracted significant controversy.</li> <li>His criticisms of certain practices were perceived as provocative, leading to backlash from conservative religious groups.</li> <li>His work on the <strong>Lingayat-Veerashaiva divide</strong> was particularly contentious.</li> <li>Kalburgi argued that Lingayatism, which emerged as a distinct movement under Basava in the 12th century, should be seen as separate from Hinduism. This view sparked heated debates within Karnataka and beyond.</li> <li>He was a strong advocate for rational thought and often questioned dogma, superstition, and traditional practices, which attracted opposition from hardline elements.</li> <li>He also supported progressive thinkers like <strong>Periyar</strong> and <strong>Dr. B. R. Ambedkar</strong>, which aligned him with other rationalist voices in India.</li> </ul>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-2'> <p>Google Ad 2</p> </div>  <h2>6. Assassination and Aftermath</h2>  <ul> <li>On August 30, 2015, M. M. Kalburgi was <strong>assassinated at his home in Dharwad, Karnataka</strong>. Two men entered his residence under the pretense of meeting him and shot him at close range.</li> <li>His murder was widely seen as a targeted attack due to his controversial views and criticism of religious orthodoxy.</li> <li>His death shocked the nation and sparked a public outcry, particularly among scholars, writers, and progressive activists.</li> <li>Kalburgi&rsquo;s assassination was part of a disturbing pattern, as similar attacks were carried out against other rationalist thinkers in India, such as <strong>Narendra Dabholkar</strong> and <strong>Govind Pansare</strong>.</li> <li>His killing raised concerns about freedom of expression and the safety of intellectuals in India, leading to protests across the country.</li> <li>Writers and academics condemned the murder and demanded action to protect freedom of thought and speech.</li> </ul>  <h2>7. Legacy and Influence</h2>  <ul> <li>Despite the controversy surrounding his work, Kalburgi remains a highly respected figure in Kannada literature and academic circles.</li> <li>His scholarship on Kannada literature, the Lingayat movement, and social reform continues to be influential.</li> <li>His assassination brought attention to the importance of safeguarding academic and intellectual freedom in India.</li> <li>The government and civil society were urged to ensure the protection of those who challenge orthodox beliefs and advocate for reform.</li> <li>Kalburgi&rsquo;s work on <strong>Vachana literature</strong> and his contributions to Kannada scholarship have inspired generations of Kannada writers and intellectuals.</li> <li>His call for progressive social reform and his fearless advocacy for rationalism continue to resonate in Karnataka.</li> </ul>  <h2>8. Awards and Honors</h2>  <ul> <li>M. M. Kalburgi received numerous awards during his lifetime in recognition of his contributions to Kannada literature and scholarship, including the <strong>Sahitya Akademi Award</strong>.</li> <li>His work was also honored by various academic and literary institutions in Karnataka, underscoring his importance as a scholar and writer.</li> </ul>  <p>M. M. Kalburgi was a distinguished Kannada scholar, literary critic, and rationalist known for his scholarly work on Kannada literature and the Lingayat tradition. His outspoken views on religion and orthodoxy, particularly within the Lingayat community, made him a controversial figure but also a champion of free thought and progressive ideals. His tragic assassination underscored the risks faced by intellectuals challenging established beliefs and sparked a nationwide debate on freedom of speech in India. Kalburgi&rsquo;s legacy endures through his writings, his influence on Kannada literature, and his unwavering commitment to rationalism and social reform.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article,&nbsp;<a href='/great-people/index.html'>for more great peoples related articles</a>&nbsp;<a href='/articles/index.html'>read our peoples blog articles</a>.</p> </div>
