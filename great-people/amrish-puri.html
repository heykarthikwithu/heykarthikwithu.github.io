His early experiences in theater played a crucial role in shaping his acting style, particularly his powerful voice and commanding presence, which later became his signature in films.</p>  <h2>Theatre Career and Foundations</h2>  <p>Before making a mark in films, Amrish Puri was actively involved in theatre. He was associated with the <strong>Indian People&rsquo;s Theatre Association (IPTA)</strong>, which was known for its socially relevant plays and strong emphasis on performance craft.</p>  <p>During this period, Puri honed his skills in dialogue delivery, expressions, and body language. His theater background gave him a deep understanding of character development, enabling him to bring authenticity and gravitas to every role he played in films.</p>  <h2>Film Debut</h2>  <p>Amrish Puri made his screen debut in the Marathi film <strong>&ldquo;Ghashiram Kotwal&rdquo; (1972)</strong>. Though the film had a limited release, it allowed Puri to showcase his acting abilities and led to further opportunities in Hindi cinema.</p>  <p>His early film roles were minor, but his dedication, discipline, and unique style gradually caught the attention of directors and producers. Puri&rsquo;s commanding presence and deep, resonant voice became his hallmark, setting him apart from other actors of his generation.</p>  <h2>Breakthrough Role</h2>  <p>Amrish Puri&rsquo;s career took a significant turn with the 1984 film <strong>&ldquo;Mashaal&rdquo;</strong>, directed by Yash Chopra.
