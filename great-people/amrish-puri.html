Over a career spanning more than four decades, he became one of the most iconic actors in the history of Indian cinema, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire actors and filmmakers.</p>  <p>This article explores Amrish Puri&rsquo;s life, career, achievements, and lasting influence on Indian cinema, while keeping your original content intact and expanding it for deeper insight.</p>  <h2>Early Life</h2>  <p>Amrish Puri was born on <strong>June 22, 1932</strong>, in Lahore, which was then part of British India and is now in Pakistan. Following the partition of India in 1947, his family moved to Mumbai, where he eventually pursued his passion for acting.</p>  <p>Growing up in a time of social upheaval and political change, Puri was drawn to the arts and theatre from a young age. His early experiences in theater played a crucial role in shaping his acting style, particularly his powerful voice and commanding presence, which later became his signature in films.</p>  <h2>Theatre Career and Foundations</h2>  <p>Before making a mark in films, Amrish Puri was actively involved in theatre. He was associated with the <strong>Indian People&rsquo;s Theatre Association (IPTA)</strong>, which was known for its socially relevant plays and strong emphasis on performance craft.</p>  <p>During this period, Puri honed his skills in dialogue delivery, expressions, and body language. His theater background gave him a deep understanding of character development, enabling him to bring authenticity and gravitas to every role he played in films.</p>  <h2>Film Debut</h2>  <p>Amrish Puri made his screen debut in the Marathi film <strong>&ldquo;Ghashiram Kotwal&rdquo; (1972)</strong>. Though the film had a limited release, it allowed Puri to showcase his acting abilities and led to further opportunities in Hindi cinema.</p>  <p>His early film roles were minor, but his dedication, discipline, and unique style gradually caught the attention of directors and producers. Puri&rsquo;s commanding presence and deep, resonant voice became his hallmark, setting him apart from other actors of his generation.</p>  <h2>Breakthrough Role</h2>  <p>Amrish Puri&rsquo;s career took a significant turn with the 1984 film <strong>&ldquo;Mashaal&rdquo;</strong>, directed by Yash Chopra. In this film, he played a powerful negative character that highlighted his ability to dominate the screen effortlessly.</p>  <p>Following <strong>&ldquo;Mashaal&rdquo;</strong>, Puri became a sought-after actor for villainous and supporting roles. He was recognized for his ability to combine menace, dignity, and complexity in his negative characters, earning him the reputation of being Bollywood&rsquo;s quintessential villain.</p>  <h2>Iconic Villainous Roles</h2>  <p>Amrish Puri is best remembered for his portrayal of villains, characters who were larger than life yet deeply human. His deep voice, intense gaze, and impeccable dialogue delivery made him one of the most formidable antagonists in Indian cinema.</p>  <p>Some of his most iconic villainous roles include:</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Mogambo in &ldquo;Mr. India&rdquo; (1987)</strong> &ndash; The role of Mogambo became legendary, and his dialogue <em>&ldquo;Mogambo khush hua&rdquo;</em> is still quoted across generations.</li> <li><strong>Bhujang in &ldquo;Nagina&rdquo; (1986)</strong> &ndash; A role that showcased his ability to combine menace with theatrical flair.</li> <li><strong>Gulbadan in &ldquo;Tridev&rdquo; (1989)</strong> &ndash; A villain with depth and personality, adding layers to the story.</li> <li><strong>Mola Ram in &ldquo;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&rdquo; (1984)</strong> &ndash; His performance brought him international recognition, showing that his talent transcended Bollywood.</li> </ul>  <h2>Notable Films</h2>  <p>While Puri is primarily known for his villainous roles, he also excelled in character roles, including supporting and comedic roles.
