Thomas, widely known simply as <strong>Dr. Jeppiaar</strong>, was one of the most influential <a href='/great-people/kaka-kalelkar.html'>educationists</a> in Tamil Nadu. As the founder of the Jeppiaar Educational Trust, he established several institutions that shaped the future of engineering and higher education in the state. His work transformed private education and expanded access for thousands of students across India.</p>  <h2>Who Was Dr. Jeppiaar?</h2>  <p>Born on <strong>June 11, 1931</strong>, Dr. Jeppiaar emerged as a powerful figure in the educational landscape of Tamil Nadu.
