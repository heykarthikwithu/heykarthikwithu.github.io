His pioneering work in IVF has played a crucial role in revolutionizing infertility treatment worldwide. Although he did not receive immediate recognition during his lifetime, his achievements have since been acknowledged and honored. In 2018, the Government of India posthumously awarded him the Padma Shri, one of the country's highest civilian honors, in recognition of his groundbreaking work.</li> </ol>  <p>Subhash Mukherjee's groundbreaking work in the field of reproductive medicine, particularly his development of the IVF technique, has had a profound impact on the lives of countless individuals and couples struggling with infertility.
