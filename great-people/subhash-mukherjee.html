                                        <div><p>Subhash Mukherjee (1931-1981) was an Indian physician and researcher who is known for his pioneering work in the field of reproductive medicine. He is credited with the development of the first successful in-vitro fertilization (IVF) technique, which led to the birth of the first IVF baby in India and the second in the world.

This achievement marked a significant breakthrough in the field of reproductive medicine.</li> <li><strong>Challenges and Recognition</strong>: Despite his groundbreaking accomplishment, Subhash Mukherjee faced significant challenges and criticism, including a lack of support from the scientific community and the media. He also experienced professional setbacks and personal difficulties. Unfortunately, these challenges took a toll on his mental health and he tragically took his own life in 1981. It was only after his death that his work received wider recognition and acknowledgment.</li>      <div class="google-ad">         <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2683569506254139" data-ad-slot="4812668708"></ins>         <script>             (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});         </script>     </div>          <li><strong>Impact on Reproductive Medicine</strong>: Subhash Mukherjee's work paved the way for advancements in the field of assisted reproductive technology.
