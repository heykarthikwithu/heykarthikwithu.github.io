During the 1960s and early 1970s, she ruled Bollywood with her beauty, talent, charm and unforgettable style. She was not only a successful <a href='/great-people/persis-khambatta.html'>actress</a> but also a cultural trendsetter whose fashion sense became a nationwide rage. Her famous <strong>&ldquo;Sadhana Cut&rdquo;</strong> hairstyle remains one of the most memorable fashion moments in Indian film history.</p>  <p>This article explores her life, career, achievements and long-lasting legacy in Indian cinema.</p>  <h2>Early Life and Background</h2>  <p>Sadhana was born on <strong>September 2, 1941</strong>, in <em>Karachi</em> (now in Pakistan), into a Sindhi Hindu family.

It marked the beginning of Sadhana&rsquo;s journey as a fashion icon.</p>  <h2>Rise to Stardom</h2>  <p>Sadhana quickly rose to the top of Bollywood. Throughout the 1960s, she was one of the most sought-after actresses, paired with leading heroes like Dev Anand, Rajendra Kumar, Manoj Kumar and Sunil Dutt.</p>  <p>She could play a romantic heroine, a dramatic character, a mysterious woman or an emotional lead&mdash;all with ease. Her expressive acting, graceful movements and natural charm set her apart.</p>  <h2>Notable Films and Landmark Performances</h2>  <p>Sadhana&rsquo;s filmography includes several classics that still remain popular today.
