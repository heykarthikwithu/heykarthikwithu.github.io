                                        <div><p>Sridevi, born as <strong>Shree Amma Yanger Ayyapan</strong>, is remembered as one of the greatest and most influential <a href='/great-people/anjali-devi.html'>actresses</a> in the history of Indian cinema. Her career, which began in childhood and extended across five major film industries, made her a household name and an evergreen icon. Even today, years after her passing, Sridevi continues to inspire millions with her talent, dedication, and unforgettable performances.</p>  <p>This article covers her early life, rise to fame, versatility, major films, achievements, and lasting legacy.</p>  <h2>Early Life and Childhood Career</h2>  <p>Sridevi was born on <strong>August 13, 1963</strong>, in <strong>Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu</strong>, into a Tamil-speaking family. She entered the world of cinema at a very young age. At just four years old, she made her acting debut as a child artist in the Tamil film <strong>&ldquo;Kandhan Karunai&rdquo; (1967)</strong>.</p>  <p>By the time most children were learning to read, Sridevi had already appeared in Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam films. Her natural expressions, innocence, and screen presence made filmmakers believe she was a rare and gifted child actor.</p>  <p>Some of her notable child roles included films like:</p>  <ul> <li>Thunaivan</li> <li>Kumara Sambhavam</li> <li>Badi Panthulu</li> <li>Poompatta (which also won her the Kerala State Film Award for Best Child Artist)</li> </ul>  <p>Her early start laid the foundation for a long, successful journey in cinema.</p>  <h2>Rise to Stardom in South Indian Cinema</h2>  <p>As she grew older, Sridevi smoothly transitioned from child roles to lead roles. She acted in all major South Indian film industries, including <strong>Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada</strong> films.</p>  <p>During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Sridevi became a top heroine in Tamil and Telugu cinema. Her expressive eyes, natural acting style, and excellent dancing skills made her stand out from her contemporaries.</p>  <p>Some of her important South Indian films include:</p>  <ul> <li>Moondru Mudichu</li> <li>16 Vayathinile</li> <li>Varumayin Niram Sivappu</li> <li>Premabhishekam</li> <li>Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari</li> <li>Kshana Kshanam</li> </ul>  <p>By this time, she was already recognized as a superstar in the South.</p>  <h2>Entry Into Bollywood and National Fame</h2>  <p>Sridevi entered Bollywood during a time when Hindi cinema was dominated by male actors. However, she soon changed that landscape. Her first major hit in Hindi was <strong>&ldquo;Himmatwala&rdquo; (1983)</strong>. The film&rsquo;s success, along with her song-and-dance popularity, established her as a leading <a href='/great-people/suhasini-maniratnam.html'>actress</a> in the Hindi film industry.</p>  <p>She followed it with several blockbusters, making her one of the only actresses capable of delivering huge hits on her own.</p>  <p>Some of her iconic Bollywood films include:</p>  <ul> <li>Sadma</li> <li>Mr. India</li> <li>Chandni</li> <li>ChaalBaaz</li> <li>Lamhe</li> <li>Khuda Gawah</li> <li>Judaai</li> </ul>  <p>Each film highlighted a different shade of her talent, proving her unmatched versatility.</p>  <h2>Versatility and Acting Style</h2>  <p>Sridevi was known for her ability to effortlessly shift between roles. She could make audiences laugh, cry, or fear for her character, all with equal ease.</p>  <h3>What made Sridevi unique:</h3>  <ol> <li><strong>Strong comic timing</strong> &ndash; As seen in ChaalBaaz and Mr. India.</li> <li><strong>Emotional depth</strong> &ndash; Her role in Sadma remains one of the most emotional performances in Indian cinema.</li> <li><strong>Graceful dancing</strong> &ndash; Songs like &ldquo;Hawa Hawai&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mere Haathon Mein&rdquo; remain evergreen.</li> <li><strong>Powerful screen presence</strong> &ndash; Her expressions alone could communicate entire emotions.</li> <li><strong>Ability to lead a film</strong> &ndash; She was among the first <a href='/great-people/bhanumathi-ramakrishna.html'>actresses</a> who could carry a film without relying on a male superstar.</li> </ol>  <p>Her talent was often compared to top global performers, and many critics called her the first true female superstar of Indian cinema.</p>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-1'> <p>Google Ad 1</p> </div>  <h2>Breakthrough and Memorable Performances</h2>  <h3>1. Sadma (1983)</h3>  <p>Sridevi delivered one of the greatest performances of her career in Sadma, where she played a woman with retrograde amnesia. The film is still regarded as a classic, and her role is considered one of the best performances in Indian film history.</p>  <h3>2. Mr. India (1987)</h3>  <p>As the iconic &ldquo;Hawa Hawai,&rdquo; Sridevi became an unstoppable sensation. Her comic scenes and glamorous presence stole the show.</p>  <h3>3. ChaalBaaz (1989)</h3>  <p>This film displayed her versatility in full strength. She played twin sisters with opposite personalities and delivered a career-defining performance.</p>  <h3>4. Lamhe (1991)</h3>  <p>Although not a commercial hit at the time, the film received critical acclaim. Today, it is considered a masterpiece, largely due to her powerful acting.</p>  <h3>5. English Vinglish (2012)</h3>  <p>This film marked Sridevi&rsquo;s comeback after 15 years. Her portrayal of a housewife learning English received worldwide praise and reminded everyone why she was a legend.</p>  <h2>Awards and Recognition</h2>  <p>Sridevi received numerous awards throughout her long career, including:</p>  <ul> <li>Several <strong>Filmfare Awards</strong> across different languages</li> <li><strong>Padma Shri</strong> in 2013</li> <li>Nandi Awards</li> <li>Tamil Nadu State Film Awards</li> <li>Kerala State Film Award</li> <li>National Film Award (posthumously for &quot;Mom&quot;)</li> </ul>  <p>She was widely loved outside India as well, especially in Gulf countries, where she was known as the <strong>&ldquo;Empress of Indian Cinema.&rdquo;</strong></p>  <h2>Return to Cinema and Later Years</h2>  <p>After taking a break from acting to focus on her family, Sridevi returned with <strong>English Vinglish</strong>, which became both a critical and commercial success. She later appeared in <strong>Mom (2017)</strong>, delivering another powerful performance.</p>  <p>Her ability to stay relevant across generations was rare.
