His research in Sanskrit, ancient Indian history and religion helped the world understand India’s cultural past with greater accuracy. Even today, his work is highly valued by students, researchers and historians.</p>  <p>This article explains his life, his major contributions and why he is remembered as a great figure in India’s intellectual history.</p>  <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>  <p>R. G. Bhandarkar was born in 1837 in Kolhapur, Maharashtra.<br> From a young age, he showed a strong interest in languages and historical studies.
