His research in Sanskrit, ancient Indian history and religion helped the world understand India&rsquo;s cultural past with greater accuracy. Even today, his work is highly valued by students, researchers and historians.</p>  <p>This article explains his life, his major contributions and why he is remembered as a great figure in India&rsquo;s intellectual history.</p>  <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>  <p>R. G. Bhandarkar was born in 1837 in Kolhapur, Maharashtra.<br /> From a young age, he showed a strong interest in languages and historical studies.
