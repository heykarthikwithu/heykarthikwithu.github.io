Often called the Tragedy Queen, she earned this title because of her unmatched ability to portray pain, longing, strength, and vulnerability on screen. Her performances touched millions of hearts, and her life story continues to inspire film lovers, writers, and historians even today.</p>  <p>Meena Kumari was not only a celebrated actress but also a gifted poet.

Acting became a way for her to support her family at a very early age.</p>  <p>She worked as a child artist in various films during the 1940s.
