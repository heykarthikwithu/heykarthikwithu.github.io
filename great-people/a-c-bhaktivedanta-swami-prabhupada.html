                                        <div><p>A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (1896&ndash;1977) is one of the most influential spiritual teachers of the modern world. He is best known as the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly called the Hare Krishna Movement. Through his writings, lectures, and global missionary work, he introduced millions of people to the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and the path of bhakti yoga, or devotion to Lord <a href='/great-people/bhaktivinoda-thakur.html'>Krishna</a>.</p>  <p>This article explores his life, his mission, his teachings, and his lasting impact on global spirituality.</p>  <h2>Early Life and Background</h2>  <p><strong>Birth Name:</strong> Abhay Charan De<br /> <strong>Birth:</strong> September 1, 1896<br /> <strong>Place:</strong> Calcutta (now Kolkata), India</p>  <p>A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was born into a devout Vaishnava family. His father, Gour Mohan De, was known for his strong devotion to Lord Krishna and often organized small devotional gatherings at home. His mother, Rajani, also encouraged spiritual values. From childhood, Abhay showed a natural inclination toward spirituality. He took part in festivals such as Janmashtami, helped with deity worship, and enjoyed reading devotional literature.</p>  <h3>1. Education</h3>  <p>He attended the well-known Scottish Church College in Kolkata, where he studied English, philosophy, and economics. This education later became an important foundation for his writing and global outreach. His fluency in English helped him communicate the teachings of Krishna consciousness to the Western world.</p>  <h3>2. Marriage and Early Career</h3>  <p>After graduation, Abhay Charan De married Radharani Devi. He worked in a pharmaceutical company and later started his own small business. Even while managing his career and family responsibilities, he remained deeply connected to spiritual life. He frequently participated in devotional programs and continued his study of sacred texts.</p>  <h2>Meeting His Spiritual Master</h2>  <p>A major turning point in his life came in <strong>1922</strong>, when he met <strong>Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur</strong>, a renowned scholar and the head of the Gaudiya Math. During their first meeting, Bhaktisiddhanta instructed Abhay to spread the teachings of Lord Krishna in the English-speaking world. This powerful instruction stayed with him for the rest of his life.</p>  <h3>Initiation and Early Spiritual Work</h3>  <p>In <strong>1933</strong>, Abhay Charan De was formally initiated into the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition. He received the spiritual name <strong>Abhay Charanaravinda</strong>. Inspired deeply by his guru, he started writing spiritual articles, translating Sanskrit texts, and distributing literature. He dedicated his life to explaining the teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, especially the practice of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra.</p>  <h2>Taking Sannyasa and Beginning His Mission</h2>  <p>In <strong>1959</strong>, at the age of 63, he accepted <strong>sannyasa</strong>, the renounced order of life, and took the name <strong>A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami</strong>. From this moment, he focused entirely on fulfilling his guru&rsquo;s instruction to spread Krishna consciousness globally.</p>  <p>For several years, he lived in Vrindavan, the holy land of Lord Krishna, writing and translating sacred books. He also prepared himself for missionary work outside India.</p>  <h2>Journey to the United States</h2>  <p>In <strong>1965</strong>, Swami Prabhupada embarked on a challenging journey to the United States. The trip itself was difficult. He traveled alone on a cargo ship called the <em>Jaladuta</em>, carrying a small trunk of books, some personal belongings, and just $7.</p>  <p>Upon arriving in New York, he faced many hardships. He had no money, no support, and no proper accommodation. However, his determination and faith in Krishna kept him moving forward. Slowly, he began giving lectures, conducting kirtans (devotional chanting), and meeting young Americans who were searching for spiritual meaning.</p>  <h2>Founding of ISKCON</h2>  <p>In <strong>1966</strong>, he officially established the <strong>International Society for <a href='/great-people/swami-vivekananda.html'>Krishna</a> Consciousness (ISKCON)</strong> in New York City. What began as a small gathering in a rented storefront soon grew into a global spiritual movement.</p>  <h3>1. Principles of ISKCON</h3>  <p>ISKCON is based on the teachings of the <strong>Bhagavad Gita</strong>, <strong>Srimad Bhagavatam</strong>, and the teachings of <strong>Chaitanya Mahaprabhu</strong>.</p>  <h3>2. Core Practices</h3>  <ol> <li> <p><strong>Chanting the Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra</strong><br /> <em>Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare<br /> Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare</em></p>  <p>Swami Prabhupada taught that chanting this mantra purifies the mind and awakens spiritual consciousness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Four Regulative Principles</strong><br /> These four principles form the moral foundation of ISKCON:</p>  <ol> <li>No meat-eating</li> <li>No intoxication</li> <li>No gambling</li> <li>No illicit sex</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bhakti Yoga</strong><br /> ISKCON emphasizes bhakti yoga, the path of devotion to Lord Krishna. This includes chanting, studying scriptures, serving the community, and living a simple, God-centered life.</p> </li> </ol>  <h2>Worldwide Expansion</h2>  <p>Under Swami Prabhupada&rsquo;s guidance, ISKCON grew at an incredible pace. Between <strong>1966 and 1977</strong>, he established more than <strong>100 temples, farms, and cultural centers</strong> across the world.</p>  <p>He traveled constantly, visiting cities in the United States, Europe, Australia, Africa, and Asia. Wherever he went, he gave lectures, inspired people to chant, and trained his disciples to carry forward the mission.</p>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-1'> <p>Google Ad 1</p> </div>  <h2>Literary Contributions</h2>  <p>One of Swami Prabhupada&rsquo;s greatest achievements is his vast literary work. His goal was to make the ancient Vedic scriptures understandable to readers around the world.</p>  <h3>1. Important Works</h3>  <ol> <li> <p><strong>Bhagavad Gita As It Is</strong><br /> His translation and commentary became one of the most widely distributed editions of the Bhagavad Gita. It presents the teachings of Krishna clearly and without personal interpretation.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Srimad Bhagavatam</strong><br /> A detailed 18-volume translation with commentary that explains spiritual philosophy, devotion, and the nature of God.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Chaitanya Charitamrita</strong><br /> A multi-volume biography of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who taught the chanting of the holy names.</p> </li> </ol>  <p>His books are now translated into more than <strong>80 languages</strong>, making them accessible to people worldwide. Even today, ISKCON temples distribute millions of his books every year.</p>  <h2>Philosophy and Teachings</h2>  <p>Swami Prabhupada shared a simple but powerful philosophy:</p>  <h3>1. Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead</h3>  <p>He taught that all living beings are eternal parts of <a href='/great-people/jiddu-krishnamurti.html'>Krishna</a> and find true happiness only in serving Him.</p>  <h3>2. Human life is meant for spiritual realization</h3>  <p>Material pursuits alone cannot satisfy the soul. Real peace and satisfaction come from spiritual practice.</p>  <h3>3. Chanting is the easiest path in the modern age</h3>  <p>Chanting the Hare Krishna mantra is the recommended spiritual practice for this age.</p>  <h3>4. Live a simple, pure, disciplined life</h3>  <p>He emphasized vegetarianism, compassion for all living beings, moral values, and community service.</p>  <h2>Awards and Recognition</h2>  <p>Swami Prabhupada received great respect both in India and abroad. After his passing, the Government of India awarded him the <strong>Padma Bhushan</strong> in recognition of his contribution to spirituality and literature.</p>  <p>ISKCON temples and festivals today attract millions of visitors. Festivals like Janmashtami, Ratha Yatra, and Gaura Purnima are celebrated grandly around the world.</p>  <h2>Final Days and Passing</h2>  <p>Swami Prabhupada passed away on <strong>November 14, 1977</strong>, in Vrindavan, India, at the age of 81. His last days were spent teaching, guiding his disciples, and chanting the holy names of Krishna. He left behind a vast spiritual movement that continues to grow.</p>  <h2>Legacy and Influence Today</h2>  <p>The legacy of A. C.
