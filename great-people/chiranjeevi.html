Over a career spanning more than four decades, he has starred in over 150 films and continues to be a major force in Indian entertainment.</p>  <p>Beyond cinema, Chiranjeevi has also contributed to politics and philanthropy, making him a respected figure both on and off the screen. His journey from a small village in Andhra Pradesh to becoming one of the biggest stars in India is truly inspiring.</p>  <p>This article explores Chiranjeevi&rsquo;s early life, acting career, achievements, political journey, philanthropic activities, and his lasting legacy.</p>  <h2>Early Life and Background</h2>  <p>Chiranjeevi was born in Mogalthur, a coastal village in West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh. His father, Konidela Venkat Rao, worked as a police constable, and his mother, Anjana Devi, was a homemaker. Growing up in a modest household, Chiranjeevi learned discipline, dedication and strong values from an early age.</p>  <h3>1. Education and Early Interests</h3>  <p>He completed his schooling in different towns due to his father&rsquo;s transfers. After finishing intermediate studies, he pursued a degree at Sri Y.N. College in Narasapuram. During his college years, he developed a strong interest in acting, inspired by stage plays and films.</p>  <p>His passion led him to join the Madras Film Institute, where he received formal training in acting. This decision completely changed the direction of his life and set the foundation for one of the greatest careers in Indian cinema.</p>  <h2>Entry into Films</h2>  <p>Chiranjeevi made his debut in 1978 with the film &ldquo;Punadhirallu.&rdquo; Though the film released later, the first movie that audiences saw him in was &ldquo;Pranam Khareedu.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Even in his early films, directors noticed his unique energy and expressive acting style. At a time when Telugu cinema was dominated by family drama and mythological themes, Chiranjeevi brought raw intensity and modern style to the screen.</p>  <h2>Breakthrough with &ldquo;Khaidi&rdquo; (1983)</h2>  <p>Chiranjeevi&rsquo;s major breakthrough came with <strong>&ldquo;Khaidi,&rdquo;</strong> a film inspired by the Hollywood classic &ldquo;First Blood.&rdquo; The movie&rsquo;s gripping story, high-voltage action scenes and Chiranjeevi&rsquo;s powerful performance made it a massive hit.</p>  <p>With &ldquo;Khaidi,&rdquo; he became an overnight star and earned the title of a dynamic action hero who could also deliver emotional depth. This film marked the beginning of his rise to superstardom.</p>  <h2>Rise to Megastar Status</h2>  <p>After &ldquo;Khaidi,&rdquo; Chiranjeevi delivered hit after hit across different genres&mdash;action, comedy, romance, social drama and fantasy.
