                                        <div><p>Harkishan Singh Surjeet (1916&ndash;2008) was one of the most influential communist leaders in India. Known for his sharp political mind, strong organizational skills and lifelong commitment to workers and farmers, Surjeet played an important role in shaping modern Indian politics. His work in building alliances, promoting secular values and strengthening the Communist Party of India (Marxist) made him a key figure in national politics for several decades.</p>  <p>This article explores his early life, political journey, major contributions, and lasting impact on India&rsquo;s <a href='/great-people/gulzarilal-nanda.html'>political</a> landscape.</p>  <h2>Early Life and Background</h2>  <h3>1. Birth and Family</h3>  <p>Harkishan Singh Surjeet was born on <strong>March 23, 1916</strong>, in <strong>Ropar</strong> (now Rupnagar) in Punjab, during the period of British India. He grew up in a farming family and was exposed early to the struggles of rural life. These experiences shaped his political thinking and later inspired him to work for farmers and workers throughout his career.</p>  <h3>2. Influence of the Freedom Movement</h3>  <p>Surjeet came of age during India&rsquo;s struggle for independence.<br /> He was influenced by:</p>  <ul> <li>The freedom movement</li> <li>Farmer struggles in Punjab</li> <li>Socialist and left-wing ideas</li> </ul>  <p>His interest in politics began early, and he soon became involved in anti-British activities, which eventually led him toward communist ideology.</p>  <h2>Entry into Communist Politics</h2>  <h3>1. Adoption of Marxist-Leninist Ideology</h3>  <p>As he grew more active in political work, Surjeet aligned himself with Marxism-Leninism. He believed that socialism was essential to uplift workers, peasants and marginalized communities.</p>  <p>He officially joined the <strong>Communist Party of India (CPI)</strong> in the 1930s, and later became part of the <strong>Communist Party of India (Marxist)</strong> or <strong>CPI(M)</strong> after the split in 1964.</p>  <h3>2. Early Political Activities</h3>  <p>Before independence, Surjeet was involved in:</p>  <ul> <li>Anti-colonial struggles</li> <li>Peasant movements</li> <li>Left-wing organizing in Punjab</li> </ul>  <p>His activism often brought him into conflict with British authorities, and he faced arrests and imprisonment multiple times. However, these challenges only strengthened his resolve.</p>  <h2>Rise in the Communist Party</h2>  <h3>1. Organizational Strength</h3>  <p>Surjeet was known for his exceptional organizational abilities.<br /> He played a key role in:</p>  <ul> <li>Strengthening party units in Punjab</li> <li>Supporting farmers&rsquo; mobilizations</li> <li>Leading workers&rsquo; unions</li> <li>Building alliances with smaller political groups</li> </ul>  <p>His calm nature, strategic thinking and ability to negotiate helped him rise steadily within the CPI(M).</p>  <h3>2.

United Front Government (1996)</h3>  <p>One of Surjeet&rsquo;s most important political achievements was his role in forming the <strong>United Front government</strong> in 1996.</p>  <p>The United Front was a coalition of non-Congress and non-BJP parties.<br /> Surjeet worked behind the scenes to bring these parties together and maintain unity.</p>  <p>This phase highlighted his talent for coalition-building and his deep influence in national politics.</p>  <h3>3.
