                                        <div><p>Abey Kuruvilla may not be the first name people recall when they think of Indian fast bowling, but his contribution to Indian <a href='/great-people/dilip-sardesai.html'>cricket</a>&mdash;both on and off the field&mdash;has been significant. His cricketing journey reflects dedication, discipline and a deep love for the game. Kuruvilla&rsquo;s story is not only about his short international stint but also about the many roles he embraced after retiring from professional cricket. From being a domestic stalwart to becoming a national selector and later a senior administrator at the BCCI, his career offers a complete arc of involvement in Indian cricket.</p>  <h2>Early Life and Passion for Cricket</h2>  <p>Abey Kuruvilla was born on <strong>August 4, 1968</strong>, in Bombay (now Mumbai), Maharashtra. Growing up in a city deeply connected with cricket, he was naturally drawn to the sport. His tall frame&mdash;standing around 6 feet 5 inches&mdash;made him a natural fit for fast bowling. While India has traditionally been a spin-dominated nation, tall pacers like Kuruvilla brought a refreshing change with their height, bounce and seam movement.</p>  <p>From his teenage years, Kuruvilla showed promise in local tournaments and age-group <a href='/great-people/lala-amarnath.html'>cricket</a>. His ability to move the ball both ways, especially on lively pitches, marked him as a bowler to watch.</p>  <h2>Rise in Domestic Cricket</h2>  <p>Kuruvilla made his <strong>first-class debut for Mumbai</strong> in the early 1990s. Mumbai&rsquo;s domestic cricket culture is known for its intensity and high standards. Many legendary Indian cricketers have come from this system, and Kuruvilla proved that he belonged there.</p>  <h3>1. What Made Him Stand Out?</h3>  <ul> <li><strong>Bounce from good length:</strong> His height gave him an advantage over most Indian bowlers.</li> <li><strong>Ability to swing the ball:</strong> Not express fast, but controlled and skillful.</li> <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Season after season, he delivered strong performances.</li> </ul>  <p>In <strong>82 first-class matches</strong>, Kuruvilla picked up close to <strong>290 wickets</strong>, an impressive record for any fast bowler in Indian domestic <a href='/great-people/vivek-razdan.html'>cricket</a>. His performances in the Ranji Trophy, especially during the mid-90s, were one of the major reasons Mumbai remained a competitive team.</p>  <p>Kuruvilla&rsquo;s strength was his discipline. He bowled long spells even on flat tracks and often worked in partnership with spinners, creating pressure through accuracy.</p>  <h2>Breakthrough into International Cricket</h2>  <p>Kuruvilla finally got his chance to represent India in <strong>1997</strong>, a time when the team struggled to find consistent fast bowlers. An injury to Javagal Srinath created an opening, and Kuruvilla was selected for the tour of the West Indies&mdash;a challenging assignment for any bowler.</p>  <h3>1. Test Career</h3>  <p>Kuruvilla played <strong>10 Test matches for India</strong>.</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Total wickets:</strong> 25</li> <li><strong>Best bowling:</strong> 5 for 68</li> </ul>  <p>His best performance came during the Test in <strong>Bridgetown, Barbados</strong>, where he took a five-wicket haul. This spell remains the highlight of his international career and showed his ability to adapt to foreign conditions.</p>  <h3>2. ODI Career</h3>  <p>Kuruvilla also played <strong>25 One Day Internationals (ODIs)</strong>.</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Total wickets:</strong> 25</li> <li><strong>Best figures:</strong> 4 for 43</li> </ul>  <p>While his ODI career was short, he played key matches against strong teams like West Indies, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.</p>  <h3>3. Why His International Career Was Short</h3>  <p>There were several reasons:</p>  <ol> <li><strong>Intense competition</strong> for pace bowling spots.</li> <li><strong>Limited opportunities</strong> in a spin-heavy era of Indian cricket.</li> <li><strong>Emergence of younger fast bowlers</strong> during the late 1990s.</li> <li><strong>Inconsistent team selection policies</strong> of that period.</li> </ol>  <p>Despite this, Kuruvilla made an impression with his discipline, accuracy and work ethic.</p>  <h2>Retirement and Transition Into Coaching</h2>  <p>Kuruvilla retired from professional cricket around <strong>2000</strong>, not because he lost form but to make space for younger fast bowlers. His decision reflected humility and a willingness to serve cricket in other roles.</p>  <p>After retirement, he moved into <strong>coaching and mentoring</strong>. He worked with various cricket bodies and academies, including the Mumbai Cricket Association and other training setups, helping develop the next generation of fast bowlers.</p>  <p>Kuruvilla&rsquo;s coaching style was practical. He focused on basics like seam position, wrist control, understanding pitches and fitness&mdash;elements that often make the difference between a good and great bowler.</p>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-1'> <p>Google Ad 1</p> </div>  <h2>Roles in Talent Scouting and Administration</h2>  <p>Kuruvilla soon transitioned into cricket administration and became an important figure in the Indian cricket structure.</p>  <h3>1. Junior Selection Committee (2008&ndash;2012)</h3>  <p>He joined the <strong>BCCI junior selection panel</strong>, where he played a role in identifying young talent. His tenure was particularly notable because India won the <strong>Under-19 World Cup in 2012</strong>&mdash;a strong indicator of the quality of scouting and player development happening in that period.</p>  <h3>2. Mumbai Chief Selector</h3>  <p>In 2012, Kuruvilla became the <strong>chief selector for Mumbai</strong>, further contributing to domestic <a href='/great-people/phiroze-palia.html'>cricket</a>. His knowledge of Mumbai&rsquo;s cricket ecosystem allowed him to bring stability and support to local players.</p>  <h3>3. Senior National Selection Committee (2020&ndash;2022)</h3>  <p>In 2020, Kuruvilla was appointed to the <strong>senior national selection panel</strong> as the West Zone representative. This position allowed him to influence Indian cricket at the highest level, helping select squads for international tours and major tournaments.</p>  <p>His role on the senior panel lasted until early 2022, after which he stepped down due to BCCI rules regarding maximum combined tenure of junior and senior selection roles.</p>  <h2>BCCI General Manager (Operations)</h2>  <p>One of the most important roles in his post-cricket career came in <strong>March 2022</strong>, when Kuruvilla was appointed the <strong>General Manager (Operations)</strong> of the BCCI. This position includes responsibilities such as:</p>  <ul> <li>Overseeing domestic tournaments</li> <li>Managing logistics for cricket operations</li> <li>Coordinating with state associations</li> <li>Implementing cricket development programs</li> <li>Ensuring smooth execution of national and domestic schedules</li> </ul>  <p>This role places him among the key decision-makers in Indian cricket administration.</p>  <h2>Bowling Style: What Made Him Unique</h2>  <p>Even though his international career was short, Kuruvilla brought qualities that set him apart:</p>  <h3>1. Height and Natural Bounce</h3>  <p>His tall structure created steep bounce, which troubled many batsmen, especially those used to playing low Indian pitches.</p>  <h3>2. Swing in Both Directions</h3>  <p>He relied more on movement than raw pace, using seam position and wrist control effectively.</p>  <h3>3. Discipline and Endurance</h3>  <p>Kuruvilla bowled long spells without losing rhythm or accuracy, a rare trait among Indian pacers of the 1990s.</p>  <h3>4. Team Player</h3>  <p>His ability to support lead bowlers and build pressure from one end made him a valuable member of the bowling unit.</p>  <h2>Contributions Beyond Playing</h2>  <p>Cricketers are often remembered only for their playing days, but Kuruvilla&rsquo;s contributions after retirement have been significant:</p>  <ul> <li>Helped shape youth cricket through junior selection</li> <li>Played a key role in Mumbai cricket&rsquo;s structure</li> <li>Served on the national selection panel</li> <li>Now holds a senior administrative post in BCCI</li> <li>Continues to support the growth of domestic cricket</li> </ul>  <p>His journey proves that a meaningful impact on the sport can be made even after hanging up one&rsquo;s boots.</p>  <h2>Legacy</h2>  <p>Abey Kuruvilla&rsquo;s legacy lies in the breadth of his contributions. While his international playing record may not be long, his dedication to <a href='/great-people/syed-mushtaq-ali.html'>cricket</a> in roles such as selector, mentor, coach and administrator has helped shape Indian cricket behind the scenes.</p>  <p>He represents the group of cricketers whose contributions go beyond scorecards. His journey&mdash;from a domestic fast bowler to a national cricket administrator&mdash;is a testament to hard work, adaptability and passion for the sport.</p>  <h2>Final Words</h2>  <p>Abey Kuruvilla&rsquo;s story is a reminder that every role in cricket&mdash;whether bowling on the field or selecting players off the field&mdash;matters. His career reflects the evolution of a cricketer who continued to serve the sport long after his playing days ended.</p>  <p>If you want more inspiring profiles of sportspersons and influential individuals, feel free to explore other articles on PeoplesBLOG.</p> </div>
