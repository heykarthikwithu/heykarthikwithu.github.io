She was also recognized for her humanitarian work and contributions to Indian society after retiring from films. This article delves into her life, career, and enduring legacy.</p>  <h2>Early Life and Family Background</h2>  <p>Nargis was born into a family with strong ties to the entertainment industry. Her mother, <strong>Jaddanbai</strong>, was a talented singer, actress, and music composer. Her father, <strong>Amin Rashid</strong>, had connections with theatre and films, but Nargis primarily grew up under her mother&rsquo;s influence.</p>  <p>Being born into a creative environment, Nargis was naturally drawn to acting. She started performing at a very young age and received guidance from her mother, which helped her understand music, acting, and stage presence early on.</p>  <h2>Early Career: From Child Artist to Leading Lady</h2>  <p>Nargis made her acting debut at the age of <strong>five</strong> in the film <strong>Talash-E-Haq (1935)</strong>. She continued acting in several films as a child artist, demonstrating remarkable talent and screen presence. Her early exposure to cinema allowed her to learn the nuances of performance and set the foundation for her later success as a leading actress.</p>  <p>In her teenage years, she transitioned into adult roles. The combination of her acting skills, expressive eyes, and natural charm quickly made her one of the most sought-after actresses in Hindi <a href='/great-people/anjali-devi.html'>cinema</a>.</p>  <h2>Breakthrough and Iconic Roles</h2>  <h3>1. Mother India (1957)</h3>  <p>Nargis&rsquo;s most celebrated performance came in <strong>Mother India</strong>, directed by <strong>Mehboob Khan</strong>.
