Known for her extraordinary acting talent, striking beauty, and versatility, she graced the screen during Bollywood&rsquo;s golden era and left an indelible mark on the hearts of audiences.</p>  <p>From her early debut as a child artist to her iconic role in <strong>Mother India</strong>, Nargis&rsquo;s career is a story of dedication, artistry, and social impact. She was also recognized for her humanitarian work and contributions to Indian society after retiring from films. This article delves into her life, career, and enduring legacy.</p>  <h2>Early Life and Family Background</h2>  <p>Nargis was born into a family with strong ties to the entertainment industry. Her mother, <strong>Jaddanbai</strong>, was a talented singer, actress, and music composer. Her father, <strong>Amin Rashid</strong>, had connections with theatre and films, but Nargis primarily grew up under her mother&rsquo;s influence.</p>  <p>Being born into a creative environment, Nargis was naturally drawn to acting. She started performing at a very young age and received guidance from her mother, which helped her understand music, acting, and stage presence early on.</p>  <h2>Early Career: From Child Artist to Leading Lady</h2>  <p>Nargis made her acting debut at the age of <strong>five</strong> in the film <strong>Talash-E-Haq (1935)</strong>. She continued acting in several films as a child artist, demonstrating remarkable talent and screen presence. Her early exposure to cinema allowed her to learn the nuances of performance and set the foundation for her later success as a leading actress.</p>  <p>In her teenage years, she transitioned into adult roles. The combination of her acting skills, expressive eyes, and natural charm quickly made her one of the most sought-after actresses in Hindi <a href='/great-people/anjali-devi.html'>cinema</a>.</p>  <h2>Breakthrough and Iconic Roles</h2>  <h3>1. Mother India (1957)</h3>  <p>Nargis&rsquo;s most celebrated performance came in <strong>Mother India</strong>, directed by <strong>Mehboob Khan</strong>. In the film, she portrayed <strong>Radha</strong>, a strong and resilient mother struggling to raise her children amidst poverty and adversity.</p>  <p>Her powerful performance won her critical acclaim and widespread admiration.
