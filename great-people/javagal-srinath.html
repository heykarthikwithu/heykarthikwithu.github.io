Nicknamed the <strong>&ldquo;Mysore Express,&rdquo;</strong> Srinath spearheaded India&rsquo;s fast-bowling attack throughout the 1990s and early 2000s&mdash;a period dominated by spinners in Indian <a href='/great-people/abey-kuruvilla.html'>cricket</a>. His remarkable pace, discipline, and professionalism made him the face of Indian fast bowling for more than a decade.</p>  <h2>Early Life and Background</h2>  <h3>1. Birth and Hometown</h3>  <p>Javagal Srinath was born in <strong>Javagal</strong>, a small village in the Hassan district of Karnataka. Growing up in a modest environment, he demonstrated both athletic talent and academic discipline from a young age.</p>  <h3>2. Education</h3>  <p>Srinath completed his engineering degree in <strong>Instrumentation Technology</strong> from <strong>Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering (SJCE)</strong> in Mysore. His technical education shaped his analytical, methodical mindset&mdash;qualities that later reflected in his approach to fast bowling.</p>  <h3>3. Early Cricketing Journey</h3>  <p>Srinath&rsquo;s potential was identified early by legendary Indian spinner <strong>Erapalli Prasanna</strong>, who mentored him during his formative years.<br /> He soon made a mark in Karnataka&rsquo;s domestic circuit, using his natural pace and height to trouble batsmen consistently. His performances in the <strong>Ranji Trophy</strong> caught national attention and paved the way for his international debut.</p>  <h2>International Debut and Rise to Prominence</h2>  <h3>1. Test Debut (1991)</h3>  <p>Srinath made his Test debut on <strong>November 29, 1991</strong>, against Australia in Brisbane. Although his early numbers were modest, his raw pace and aggression stood out, signaling the arrival of a rare Indian fast bowler.</p>  <h3>2. ODI Debut (1991)</h3>  <p>He made his ODI debut earlier that same year, on <strong>October 18, 1991</strong>, against Pakistan in Sharjah. This format would eventually become his greatest strength, as he went on to become <strong>India&rsquo;s first bowler to take 300 ODI wickets</strong>.</p>  <h2>Career Highlights and Achievements</h2>  <h3>1. Leading India&rsquo;s Pace Attack</h3>  <p>For most of his career, Srinath was the <strong>sole fast-bowling spearhead</strong> in an Indian team heavily reliant on spinners.

Pace</h3>  <p>At his peak, Srinath regularly clocked <strong>150 km/h</strong>, making him one of the fastest bowlers India had produced at the time.</p>  <h3>2. Accuracy</h3>  <p>He combined speed with exceptional control, making him effective in both the opening overs and death overs.</p>  <h3>3. Reverse Swing</h3>  <p>Srinath became a master of <strong>reverse swing</strong>, especially on worn subcontinental pitches.
