                                <div><p>Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother. One day, their mother said, “My dear <a href="/articles/hydropower-experiment-science-experiment-for-children.html" title="Read about Hydropower Experiment Science Experiment For Children">children</a>, you are grown now. Go out into the world and build homes of your own. But remember—whatever you do, do it well.”</p>  <p>So the three little pigs set off on their journey.</p>  <p>The <strong>first little pig</strong> was in a hurry. He wanted to play and have fun, so he built his house quickly with <strong>straw</strong>. It was light and easy to stack, and soon he was finished. “Now I can play all day!” he said happily.</p>  <p>The <strong>second little pig</strong> worked a little harder. He built his house with <strong>sticks</strong>. It took longer than straw, but it was stronger. “This will do just fine,” he said, proud of his work.</p>  <p>The <strong>third little pig</strong> was wise and patient. He wanted his house to be safe and strong. So he built it carefully with <strong>bricks</strong>. It took much time and effort, but at last, he had a sturdy home.</p>  <p>Not long after, a <strong>big bad wolf</strong> came along. He was hungry and saw the first little pig’s straw house.</p>  <p>“Little pig, little pig, let me come in!” the wolf growled.<br> “Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!” squeaked the little pig.</p>  <p>“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in!” roared the wolf. And with one big blow—<strong>whoosh!</strong>—the straw house flew apart. The first little pig ran as fast as he could to his brother’s stick house.</p>    <p>The wolf followed and knocked on the door.<br> “Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!”<br> “Not by the hair of our chinny-chin-chins!” they replied.</p>  <p>“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in!” The wolf blew with all his might, and <strong>CRASH!</strong>—the stick house tumbled down. The two pigs squealed and ran to their brother’s brick house.</p>  <p>The wolf came after them and banged on the door.<br> “Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!”<br> “Not by the hair of our chinny-chin-chins!” answered the three pigs together.</p>  <p>“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in!” The wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he blew with all his strength—but the brick house stood firm. Again and again, he tried, but the strong brick walls would not fall.</p>  <p>At last, the tired wolf gave up. “I’ll find my dinner somewhere else!” he grumbled, and he ran off into the forest, never to bother the pigs again.</p>  <p>The three little pigs danced with joy. They hugged their clever brother and said, “Your hard work saved us all!” From that day, they lived happily and safely in the sturdy brick house.</p>  <p><strong>Moral of the Story:</strong><br> <em>“Hard work and patience always pay off, while laziness can bring trouble.”</em></p></div>
