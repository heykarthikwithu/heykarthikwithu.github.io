                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a quiet village surrounded by green hills, flowing streams, and a dense green forest, there lived two best friends named Sam and Leo. Everyone in the village knew them well, not just because they were cheerful boys, but because they were always seen together. From early childhood, they had shared everything &mdash; their toys, their meals, their schoolbooks, and even their dreams. People often smiled and said, &ldquo;If you see Sam, Leo will not be far behind.&rdquo; Their friendship was so strong that many believed nothing in the world could ever separate them.</p>  <p>They walked to school together every day, helped each other with homework, and spent their evenings playing near the fields or listening to stories from the elders. Whenever one got into trouble, the other was always there to help. Because of this, they proudly believed they were true friends who would stand by each other no matter what. Their bond seemed unbreakable, like two branches growing from the same tree.</p>  <p>One pleasant morning, when the sky was clear and the air smelled fresh after a light drizzle, they decided to go into the nearby forest to collect berries and enjoy a small adventure. The forest was famous in the village for its natural beauty &mdash; tall trees touching the sky, birds chirping sweet melodies, butterflies fluttering between flowers, and cool shade that protected travelers from the harsh sun. But the forest was also known for its dangers. Wild animals, especially bears and wolves, sometimes wandered near the walking paths.</p>  <p>As the boys prepared to leave, an old villager noticed them carrying small baskets. With a serious look, he called out, &ldquo;Be careful, children. The forest is beautiful, but it can be dangerous. Stay together and protect each other. Never leave your friend alone, no matter what happens.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Sam and Leo nodded confidently and replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, uncle. We will stay together.&rdquo;</p>  <p>With excitement in their hearts, they began their journey.</p>  <p>As they walked deeper into the woods, they laughed loudly, talked about their future plans, and challenged each other to spot the most colorful birds or the ripest berries. Sunlight filtered gently through the thick leaves above them, creating golden patterns on the ground. The cool breeze and the peaceful sounds of nature made everything feel magical and safe. For a while, they completely forgot the old man&rsquo;s warning.</p>  <p>Everything seemed perfect.</p>  <p>Suddenly, the peaceful silence broke.</p>  <p>There was a loud rustling sound behind the bushes.</p>  <p>The leaves shook violently, and twigs snapped under heavy footsteps.</p>  <p>Before they could react, a huge brown bear stepped onto the narrow path. It was larger than anything they had ever seen before. Its thick fur glistened in the sunlight, and its deep growl echoed through the forest. The bear lifted its head, sniffed the air, and began moving toward them.</p>  <p>Both friends froze in fear.</p>  <p>Their laughter disappeared instantly.</p>  <p>Their hearts started pounding loudly in their chests.</p>  <p>Sam reacted first. Without thinking clearly, fear took control of him. His only thought was to save himself. He quickly ran to the nearest tree and scrambled up its trunk. Using all his strength, he climbed higher and higher until he reached a safe branch. Within seconds, he was out of reach, clinging tightly to the tree.</p>  <p>But Leo was not a good climber.</p>  <p>He tried to follow Sam, but his hands slipped on the rough bark. The tree was too tall, and his legs were shaking too much. The bear was coming closer with every step. Panic filled his mind. There was nowhere to hide and nowhere to run. He realized he couldn&rsquo;t escape.</p>  <p>For a moment, he felt abandoned and helpless.</p>  <p>Then, suddenly, he remembered something his grandfather had once told him: &ldquo;If you ever face a bear and cannot run, lie still and pretend to be dead. Bears usually do not attack dead bodies.&rdquo;</p>  <p>It was his only chance.</p>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-1'> <p>Google Ad 1</p> </div>  <p>Thinking quickly, Leo lay flat on the ground. He pressed his face into the soil, kept his arms by his sides, held his breath, and pretended to be lifeless. He forced himself not to move, even though every part of his body trembled with fear.</p>  <p>The bear approached slowly.</p>  <p>Leo could hear its heavy breathing.</p>  <p>He could feel the ground shake with each step.</p>  <p>The bear sniffed around his head, ears, and clothes. Its warm, smelly breath brushed against his face. For a terrifying moment, Leo thought the bear could hear his heartbeat. His chest felt tight, and he wanted to scream, but he stayed perfectly still.</p>  <p>Seconds felt like hours.</p>  <p>Finally, after a long and tense moment, the bear lost interest. Believing Leo was already dead, it turned away and slowly wandered back into the forest.</p>  <p>Silence returned.</p>  <p>Only when everything was completely quiet did Leo carefully open his eyes and take a deep breath.</p>  <p>Up in the tree, Sam had watched the entire scene. Once he was sure the bear was gone, he climbed down slowly. He felt relieved but also embarrassed.</p>  <p>Trying to hide his fear, he forced a small laugh and said, &ldquo;Hey Leo, the bear was so close to your face. It looked like it whispered something to you. What did it say?&rdquo;</p>  <p>Leo stood up, brushed the dirt from his clothes, and looked at Sam seriously. His eyes showed disappointment more than fear.</p>  <p>He replied calmly, &ldquo;The bear gave me some advice. It told me never to trust a friend who abandons you in times of danger.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Sam&rsquo;s smile disappeared instantly.</p>  <p>The words hit him harder than anything else.</p>  <p>He suddenly realized what he had done. While Leo had faced the bear alone, he had climbed the tree and saved only himself. He had forgotten their promise. He had forgotten what true friendship meant.</p>  <p>Shame filled his heart.</p>  <p>With tears in his eyes, Sam said softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Leo. I was scared and acted selfishly. I didn&rsquo;t even think about you. I should have helped you. Please forgive me.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Leo looked at his friend for a moment. He knew Sam was truly sorry.</p>  <p>&ldquo;Fear can make anyone forget their values,&rdquo; Leo said gently. &ldquo;But true friends learn from their mistakes and become better.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Sam nodded. From that day forward, he kept his promise. He never left Leo&rsquo;s side, whether they were in school, in the fields, or walking through the forest. He learned that real friendship means courage, loyalty, and standing together even during danger.</p>  <p>Their bond grew stronger than ever before, not because everything was easy, but because they had faced fear and learned an important life lesson together.</p>  <h3>Moral of the Story</h3>  <p>A true friend stands by you in times of trouble. Fair-weather friends may disappear when life gets hard, but loyal and trustworthy friends stay beside you, protect you, and prove their friendship through actions, not just words.</p> </div>
