                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a grand and beautiful kingdom, there lived a kind and gentle princess named Nisha. She had <a href="/articles/why-do-i-apologize-for-everything-and-how-to-avoid-doing-it.html" title="Read about Why Do I Apologize For Everything And How To Avoid Doing It">everything</a> a princess could wish for luxurious dresses, a beautiful palace and all the comforts of royal life. But despite all this, Princess Nisha was lonely and longed for a true friend.</p>  <p>One fine day, while walking through the lush palace gardens, Princess Nisha came upon a beautiful pond. She often visited this peaceful spot to reflect on her thoughts and dreams. As she sat by the edge of the pond, admiring her golden ball, she tossed it playfully into the air. Unfortunately, this time, she tossed it too high and it slipped from her hands, falling into the deep water with a splash.</p>  <p>"<em>Oh no!</em>" cried Princess Nisha. "<em>My golden ball!</em>"</p>  <p>As she stared into the water, despair washing over her, a voice came from beneath the surface. "<em>Why do you cry, fair princess?</em>"</p>  <p>Startled, Nisha looked around and found a small frog sitting on a lily pad near the edge of the pond. "<em>I lost my favorite golden ball</em>", she replied sadly. "<em>It has fallen into the deep water and I cannot reach it</em>".</p>  <p>The frog, with his big, round eyes, looked at her thoughtfully. "<em>I can retrieve your golden ball</em>", he said, "<em>but what will you give me in return?</em>"</p>    <p>The princess, eager to have her ball back, quickly promised, "<em>Oh, dear frog, you may have anything you wish—riches, jewels, or even my crown</em>".</p>  <p>But the frog shook his head. "<em>I do not want your riches or your crown, Princess. All I ask is that you let me be your companion—let me sit with you, eat with you and sleep by your side for three days</em>".</p>  <p>Princess Nisha hesitated. The thought of spending time with a frog did not sit well with her, but desperate to retrieve her golden ball, she reluctantly agreed. "<em>Very well, I promise</em>", she said.</p>  <p>With that, the frog dived into the pond and within moments, he resurfaced with the golden ball. The princess thanked him and hurried back to the palace, forgetting all about her promise to the frog.</p>  <p>That evening, as the princess sat down for dinner in the grand dining hall, there was a knock at the door. When the servant opened it, to Princess Nisha’s surprise, there stood the frog. "<em>Princess, you made a promise</em>", he said in a gentle yet firm voice.</p>  <p>Nisha was dismayed but remembered her promise. Reluctantly, she invited the frog inside. The frog hopped up to the table and dined with her. Later that night, when it was time for bed, the frog asked to sleep beside her, as promised. Despite her discomfort, the princess allowed the frog to sleep at the foot of her bed.</p>  <p>For the next two days, the frog kept by the princess’s side and she found herself growing less repulsed by him and more curious about his kind and wise nature. By the third day, she had begun to see the frog not as a slimy creature but as a true friend who kept his word and brought her comfort.</p>    <p>On the final night of their time together, something extraordinary happened. As the frog lay at the foot of her bed, Princess Nisha leaned down and gave him a gentle kiss on his head as a gesture of friendship and gratitude.</p>  <p>At that very moment, the frog transformed into a handsome prince, standing tall and regal before her. The princess gasped in surprise.</p>  <p>"<em>Thank you, Princess Nisha</em>", the prince said. "<em>I was cursed by a wicked sorceress to live as a frog until someone saw past my appearance and treated me with kindness. Your friendship and compassion have freed me from the curse</em>".</p>  <p>The princess was overjoyed. The prince, now restored to his true form, asked for her hand in <a href="/articles/is-life-worth-living-without-marriage.html" title="Read about Is Life Worth Living Without Marriage">marriage</a>, not because of her beauty or wealth but because of her kind and gentle heart. Princess Nisha, who had longed for true companionship, accepted, knowing she had found a friend and partner who valued her for who she truly was.</p>  <p>And so, the prince and the princess were married and lived happily ever after, their bond built on kindness, respect and love.</p>  <p><strong>Moral of the story:</strong> True beauty lies within and kindness and compassion are far more valuable than outward appearances. Sometimes, the most unlikely friendships can blossom into the greatest of blessings.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more quick reads read our peoples blog articles.</p></div>
