                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a lush and verdant forest, there lived a wise old frog named Manas. Manas was known throughout the forest for his keen intellect and his ability to see the best in everyone, even those with a less-than-stellar reputation.</p>  <p>One day, as Manas was basking in the warm glow of the sun near the edge of a tranquil pond, he heard a small voice calling out to him.</p>  <p>"<em>Excuse me, Mr. Frog</em>" the voice said. "<em>Could you please help me?</em>"</p>  <p>Curious, Manas turned to see a scorpion struggling in the water, its tiny legs thrashing about as it fought against the current.</p>  <p>"<em>I cannot swim</em>", the scorpion explained. "<em>Please, Mr. Frog, will you help me to cross the pond?</em>"</p>  <p>At first, Manas hesitated. After all, scorpions were known for their venomous sting and helping one could be dangerous. But Manas was a kind-hearted soul and he could not bear to see any creature suffer.</p>  <p>"<em>Very well</em>", Manas said at last. "<em>Climb onto my back and I will carry you across the pond</em>".</p>  <p>With a sense of relief, the scorpion climbed onto Manas's back and together they began to make their way across the water. As they swam, Manas couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. After all, he knew the reputation of scorpions and their deadly sting.</p>  <p>"<em>Tell me, Mr. Scorpion</em>", Manas said. "<em>Why should I trust you not to sting me as we cross the pond?</em>"</p>  <p>The scorpion paused for a moment, considering Manas's question.</p>    <p>"<em>You have nothing to fear</em>", the scorpion replied. "<em>For if I were to sting you, we would both drown and that is not my <a href="/articles/how-to-design-your-dream-morning-with-intention.html" title="Read about How To Design Your Dream Morning With Intention">intention</a></em>".</p>  <p>With those words, Manas felt reassured and they continued on their journey across the pond.</p>  <p>But as they reached the middle of the pond, Manas felt a sharp pain in his back. To his horror, he realized that the scorpion had stung him.</p>  <p>"<em>Why would you do such a thing?</em>" Manas cried out in pain.</p>  <p>The scorpion looked at Manas with sadness in its eyes.</p>  <p>"<em>I'm sorry, Mr. Frog</em>" the scorpion said. "<em>It's just my nature. I cannot help but sting, even when it means causing harm to those who would help me</em>".</p>  <p>With that, the scorpion slipped beneath the surface of the water, leaving Manas to struggle alone.</p>  <p>Despite the pain of the scorpion's sting, Manas managed to make his way to the shore, where he collapsed in exhaustion. As he lay there, he pondered the lesson he had learned from his encounter with the scorpion.</p>  <p>In the end, Manas realized that sometimes, no matter how kind and generous we may be, there are those who will take advantage of our goodwill. And while it is <a href="/articles/why-is-living-a-healthy-lifestyle-important.html" title="Read about Why Is Living A Healthy Lifestyle Important">important</a> to help others whenever we can, we must also be cautious and mindful of our own well-being.</p>  <p>The <strong>moral of the story</strong> is that sometimes, people will act in accordance with their nature, even if it means causing harm to others. The tale of the frog and the scorpion reminds us to be wary of those who may take advantage of our kindness and to always be mindful of our own safety and well-being.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more quick reads read our peoples blog articles.</p></div>
