                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a <a href="/articles/creativity-boosting-activities-to-have-a-peaceful-life.html" title="Read about Creativity Boosting Activities To Have A Peaceful Life">peaceful</a> kingdom in the hills of Himachal Pradesh, there lived a kind and gentle queen. One day, as she sat by her window, sewing by the snow, she pricked her finger. As she looked at the drop of blood on the white snow, she whispered, “I wish for a daughter with skin as fair as snow, lips as red as a rose, and hair as black as the night.”</p>  <p>Not long after, the queen had a <a href="/articles/always-keep-it-classy-and-stay-strong-because-strong-is-beautiful.html" title="Read about Always Keep It Classy And Stay Strong Because Strong Is Beautiful">beautiful</a> baby girl just like she had wished. She named her <strong>Snow White</strong>. But sadly, the queen fell ill and passed away. The king remarried, and the new queen was beautiful but very proud and cruel.</p>  <p>This new queen had a magical mirror. Every day, she would ask,<br> “Mirror, mirror on the wall,<br> Who is the fairest of them all?”</p>  <p>The mirror always replied, “You are, O Queen.”<br> But one day, the mirror answered, “Snow White is the fairest of them all.”</p>  <p>Jealous and furious, the queen ordered a soldier to take Snow White deep into the forest and leave her there. But the kind soldier couldn’t harm her. He let her go and told her to run far away.</p>  <p>Snow White wandered through the thick forest, frightened and tired, until she came upon a tiny cottage. Inside, <a href="/articles/why-do-i-apologize-for-everything-and-how-to-avoid-doing-it.html" title="Read about Why Do I Apologize For Everything And How To Avoid Doing It">everything</a> was small—little chairs, tiny bowls, and beds. She cleaned the cottage and fell asleep in one of the beds.</p>  <p>The cottage belonged to seven little dwarfs who worked in the nearby hills digging for gems. When they came home and found Snow White, they were surprised, but also happy to have her. She told them her story, and they promised to keep her safe.</p>  <p>But the wicked queen soon found out Snow White was still alive. Disguising herself as an old woman, she went to the cottage and gave Snow White a poisoned apple. With one bite, Snow White fell into a deep, magic sleep.</p>  <p>The dwarfs were heartbroken. They placed her gently in a glass coffin in the forest. One day, a kind prince, who had heard tales of Snow White’s beauty and kindness, came to see her. When he gently lifted her, the piece of poisoned apple fell from her mouth—and she opened her eyes!</p>  <p>Snow White was awake! The prince and the dwarfs were overjoyed. Snow White smiled and thanked them all for their love. The prince asked her to come with him to his palace, and Snow White agreed.</p>  <p>They were married with great celebration, and Snow White lived happily ever after in peace and joy, always remembering her little friends in the forest.</p>  <p><strong>Moral of the Story:</strong><br> <em>“True beauty lies in kindness and honesty. Even in hard times, goodness always finds a way to shine.”</em></p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more quick reads read our peoples blog articles.</p></div>
