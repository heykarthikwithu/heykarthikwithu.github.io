                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a small village near a dense forest, there lived a poor farmer named Ramu. He worked tirelessly on his small piece of land but barely earned enough to feed his family. Despite his struggles, Ramu was kind-hearted and never wished harm upon anyone.</p>  <p>One day, while working in his field, he found a shimmering golden egg lying in the nest of his old goose. His eyes widened in disbelief. <em>“Could this be real?”</em> he wondered. Carefully, he picked up the egg and took it home. When he showed it to a goldsmith in the village, the man confirmed that it was indeed pure gold.</p>  <p>Ramu was overjoyed. He sold the golden egg for a good price and used the money to buy food and other necessities for his family. The next morning, when he went to check on his goose, he was astonished to find another golden egg in its nest. Day after day, the goose laid a single golden egg, making Ramu and his family wealthier than ever.</p>  <p>With his newfound fortune, Ramu’s life changed completely. He no longer had to struggle for food or money. However, as time passed, greed started creeping into his heart. He thought, <em>“Why should I wait for just one egg every day? What if I could get all the golden eggs at once?”</em></p>    <p>Blinded by greed, Ramu decided to kill the goose, believing that there must be a huge pile of golden eggs inside its belly. The next morning, he took a sharp knife and, without thinking twice, killed the innocent bird. But to his great shock and sorrow, when he cut open the goose, there were no golden eggs inside—only flesh and blood like any other bird.</p>  <p>Ramu fell to his knees, realizing the terrible mistake he had made. His greed had cost him dearly. If only he had been patient, the goose would have continued to give him golden eggs for a lifetime. But now, his source of wealth was gone forever.</p>  <p>With tears in his eyes, Ramu walked back home, filled with regret. From that day forward, he learned a valuable lesson: greed only leads to loss and suffering.</p>  <p><strong>Moral of the Story:</strong><br> <em>"Greed leads to destruction."</em> One should always be content and patient. Greed can make you lose even what you already have.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more quick reads read our peoples blog articles.</p></div>
