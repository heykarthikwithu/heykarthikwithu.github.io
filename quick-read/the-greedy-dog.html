                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a small village named Sonpur, there lived a stray dog called Moti. He was always on the lookout for food and never liked to share anything with others. His greed often got him into trouble, but he never learned his lesson.</p>  <p>One day, while wandering through the village, Moti found a juicy bone outside a butcher’s shop. His eyes sparkled with joy. <em>What a delicious treat!</em> he thought. Quickly, he grabbed the bone in his mouth and ran away before anyone could take it from him.</p>  <p>Moti decided to take the bone to a quiet place where he could enjoy it in peace. As he walked, he came across a narrow wooden bridge that stretched over a river. While crossing the bridge, he <a href="/articles/what-happened-at-a-wedding-that-made-you-feel-horrible-in-india.html" title="Read about What Happened At A Wedding That Made You Feel Horrible In India">happened</a> to look down and saw his <a href="/articles/communication-and-self-reflection-strategies.html" title="Read about Communication And Self Reflection Strategies">reflection</a> in the water.</p>  <p>Not realizing it was just his own image, Moti thought, <em>Oh! There’s another dog in the water, and he has a bigger bone than mine! I must have that bone too!</em></p>  <p>Driven by greed, Moti growled at his reflection. But the dog in the water also seemed to growl back at him. Annoyed, Moti decided to scare the other dog away and take his bone. So, he opened his mouth to bark—<strong>and as soon as he did, his own bone fell into the river!</strong></p>  <p>Moti watched in horror as the bone sank into the water and disappeared. He tried to reach for it, but it was too late. Now, he had nothing. Feeling foolish and sad, he walked away, realizing his own greed had cost him the delicious bone he already had.</p>  <p>From that day on, Moti learned to be satisfied with what he had and never to be greedy again.</p>  <p><strong>Moral of the story:</strong> <strong>"Greed can make you lose what you already have."</strong> Be grateful for what you possess instead of always wanting more.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more quick reads read our peoples blog articles.</p></div>
