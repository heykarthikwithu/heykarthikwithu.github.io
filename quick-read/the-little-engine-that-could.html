                                <div><p>In a small town nestled between rolling hills, there was a little blue engine. It wasn't the biggest or the strongest, but it had a heart full of determination. One day, a big train carrying toys and goodies for <a href="/articles/coin-inertia-science-experiment-for-children.html" title="Read about Coin Inertia Science Experiment For Children">children</a> broke down on its way over the mountain.</p>  <p>The toys and goodies were stranded and the town was sad because the children were eagerly waiting for their treats. The big engines in the train yard refused to help, claiming they were too important and had more important things to do.</p>  <p>The little blue engine, overhearing the dilemma, felt a sense of responsibility. It chugged over to the broken-down train and looked at the massive mountain ahead. Doubtful faces surrounded it, but the little blue engine whispered to itself, "I think I can, I think I can."</p>  <p>With a deep breath, the little blue engine hooked itself to the train and started pulling. The load was heavy and the mountain was steep, but the little engine kept repeating, "I think I can, I think I can."</p>    <p>Slowly but surely, the little engine inched its way up the mountain. The toys and goodies were heavy and the climb was tough, but the little blue engine refused to give up. As it reached the top, it exclaimed with joy, "I thought I could, I thought I could!"</p>  <p>The townspeople cheered and the children were overjoyed as the little blue engine delivered the treats to them. The little blue engine became a hero, not because it was the biggest or the fastest, but because it believed in itself and was determined to do what others thought was impossible.</p>  <p>The <strong>moral of the story</strong> is that a positive attitude, coupled with determination, can help overcome challenges. No matter how small or seemingly insignificant, each one of us has the potential to make a big difference through effort, belief and perseverance.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more quick reads read our peoples blog articles.</p></div>
