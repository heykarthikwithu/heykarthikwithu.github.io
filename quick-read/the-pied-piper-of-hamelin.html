                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in the small Indian town of Nandipur, there was a terrible problem. The town was overrun by rats. They were everywhere&mdash;running through the streets, eating the grain, and even sneaking into people&#39;s homes. The townspeople tried everything they could think of to get rid of the rats, but nothing worked. They were desperate and didn&#39;t know what to do.</p>  <p>One day, a mysterious man arrived in the town. He was dressed in colorful clothes and carried a wooden flute. Introducing himself as Mohan, the flute player, he said to the townspeople, &quot;I can rid your town of these rats. But it will cost you a hundred gold coins.&quot;</p>  <p>The townspeople agreed eagerly, promising to pay the man if he could truly rid the town of the rats.</p>  <p>Mohan took out his flute and began to play a strange, enchanting tune. As the music floated through the streets, the rats began to emerge from their hiding places. Mesmerized by the music, they followed Mohan as he walked through the town, playing his flute. He led the rats to the riverbank, where they all jumped into the water and drowned.</p>  <p>The townspeople were overjoyed and celebrated their victory. But when Mohan returned to claim his reward, the greedy town leaders refused to pay him the hundred gold coins. &quot;Why should we give you so much gold for something as simple as playing a flute?&quot; they sneered.</p>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-1'> <p>Google Ad 1</p> </div>  <p>Mohan warned them, &quot;You promised to pay me, and if you don&rsquo;t, you will regret it.&quot;</p>  <p>The leaders laughed and dismissed him. Angry and betrayed, Mohan took out his flute and began to play another melody. This time, it was not the rats that followed him, but the children of the town. One by one, they came running out of their homes, enchanted by the music. Mohan led them out of Nandipur and into the nearby forest. When the music stopped, the children disappeared.</p>  <p>The townspeople were horrified and begged Mohan to bring their children back. They promised to pay him whatever he wanted. Mohan finally agreed but made them swear to always keep their promises. Only then did he play his flute again, leading the children back to the town.</p>  <p>From that day on, the people of Nandipur kept their word and learned the importance of honesty.</p>  <p><strong>Moral of the story:</strong> <strong>&quot;Always keep your promises and never cheat others.&quot;</strong> Breaking a promise can lead to dire consequences and loss of trust.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article,&nbsp;<a href='/quick-read/index.html'>for more quick reads</a>&nbsp;<a href='/articles/index.html'>read our peoples blog articles</a>.</p> </div>
