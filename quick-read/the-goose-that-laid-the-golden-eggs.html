                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a <strong>poor farmer</strong> and his wife. They worked very hard every day but still found it <a href="/articles/why-is-corporate-life-so-challenging-and-difficult.html" title="Read about Why Is Corporate Life So Challenging And Difficult">difficult</a> to earn enough to live comfortably. One morning, while feeding their animals, the farmer discovered something unusual in the nest of his goose.</p>  <p>To his surprise, the goose had laid a <strong>shiny golden egg</strong>! At first, he thought it must be a trick, but when he picked it up, he realized it was truly made of gold. Overjoyed, he ran to his wife and said, “Look! Our goose has given us a golden egg. We will never be poor again!”</p>  <p>Every day after that, the goose laid one golden egg. Slowly, the farmer and his wife became rich. They bought a bigger house, new clothes, and had plenty of food. The farmer should have been satisfied and grateful—but greed began to grow in his heart.</p>  <p>One day, the wife said, “If the goose lays a golden egg every day, then surely there must be many golden eggs inside her. Why should we wait day by day? Let’s cut her open and take them all at once!”</p>  <p>The farmer hesitated, but his greed overcame his sense. He thought, <em>If we have all the gold now, we will be the richest people in the land.</em> So, the foolish farmer killed the goose. But when he opened it, there were <strong>no golden eggs inside</strong>—only an ordinary goose like any other.</p>  <p>The farmer and his wife were heartbroken. Their source of wealth was gone forever. Instead of being the richest people, they had lost everything because of their greed.</p>  <p>From that day, the farmer learned a painful lesson—<em>those who want too much, too quickly, often lose everything in the end.</em></p>  <p><strong>Moral of the Story:</strong><br> <em>“Greed can destroy the good things we already have. Be patient and grateful.”</em></p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more quick reads read our peoples blog articles.</p></div>
