                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a small coastal village in India, there lived a poor fisherman named Ravi and his wife, Kamala. They lived in a tiny hut near the sea and survived on whatever fish Ravi could catch each day. Though they had little, Ravi was content with his life. However, Kamala was always dissatisfied and wanted more.</p>  <p>One day, while fishing in the ocean, Ravi caught a beautiful golden fish. To his surprise, the fish spoke in a gentle voice, <em>"Please let me go, kind fisherman. I am no ordinary fish—I am a magical fish! If you spare my life, I will grant you any wish."</em></p>  <p>Ravi, being a kind man, did not desire anything for himself. He let the fish go, saying, <em>"I need nothing, dear fish. Go and live freely in the ocean."</em></p>  <p>When Ravi returned home and told Kamala about the magical fish, she was furious. <em>"How could you let such an opportunity go to waste?"</em> she scolded. <em>"Go back and ask the fish for a big house! I am tired of living in this small hut."</em></p>  <p>Ravi, though reluctant, returned to the sea and called out to the golden fish. The fish appeared and said, <em>"What do you wish for, kind fisherman?"</em></p>  <p>With hesitation, Ravi replied, <em>"My wife wishes for a big house."</em></p>  <p><em>"Go home, and you shall have it,"</em> said the fish, and with a splash, it disappeared.</p>  <p>When Ravi reached home, he was astonished to see that his tiny hut had transformed into a grand house. Kamala was overjoyed, but her greed only grew stronger.</p>    <p>The next day, she demanded, <em>"Go back and ask for a palace! I want to be richer than anyone in the village."</em></p>  <p>Ravi, though unhappy, went back to the sea and made the wish. The magical fish granted it, and soon, Kamala was living in a magnificent palace. But even that was not enough.</p>  <p><em>“Now I want to be the queen! Tell the fish to make me the ruler of this land,”</em> Kamala ordered.</p>  <p>Ravi hesitated but obeyed. This time, when he called the fish, the sky turned dark, and the sea became rough. The golden fish appeared, looking displeased.</p>  <p><em>"Go home, fisherman,"</em> it said, <em>"for your wife’s greed has gone too far."</em></p>  <p>When Ravi returned, he found his grand palace had vanished, and in its place was the same small hut they had once lived in. Kamala wept bitterly, realizing that her endless greed had taken away <a href="/articles/look-deep-into-the-nature-and-then-you-will-understand-everything-better.html" title="Read about Look Deep Into The Nature And Then You Will Understand Everything Better">everything</a>. But it was too late.</p>  <p>From that day on, she learned to be content with what she had, and Ravi was happy to live simply once again.</p>  <p><strong>Moral of the Story:</strong><br> <em>"Greed never leads to happiness; one should be content with what they have."</em></p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more quick reads read our peoples blog articles.</p></div>
