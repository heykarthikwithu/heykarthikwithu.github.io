                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a small village in India, there lived a kind-hearted farmer named Gopal. He was known for his generosity and willingness to help anyone in need. He worked hard on his farm, and though he was not very rich, he was always content with what he had.</p>  <p>One winter morning, as Gopal was walking through his fields, he saw something unusual lying on the ground. As he moved closer, he realized it was a snake, frozen stiff due to the cold. The snake lay lifeless, barely <a href="/articles/leaf-breathing-science-experiment-for-children.html" title="Read about Leaf Breathing Science Experiment For Children">breathing</a>.</p>  <p>Gopal felt pity for the creature. <em>“Poor thing! It must have been caught in the cold all night. If I don’t help it, it will surely die.”</em></p>  <p>Without thinking of the danger, Gopal carefully picked up the snake and tucked it inside his shawl to keep it warm. He carried it home and placed it near the fire, hoping it would regain its strength. After some time, the warmth of the fire revived the snake. It slowly opened its eyes and slithered around.</p>  <p>Just as Gopal was about to feel happy for saving the creature, the snake suddenly reared its head, hissed, and lunged at him, ready to strike!</p>    <p>Gopal quickly stepped back and grabbed a stick. <em>“You ungrateful creature!”</em> he shouted. <em>“I saved your life, and now you want to bite me?”</em></p>  <p>The snake hissed and replied, <em>“It is in my nature to bite, no matter how kind someone is to me.”</em></p>  <p>Realizing the danger, Gopal wasted no more time. He swung his stick and struck the snake, killing it instantly. He then sighed and said, <em>“Kindness should be shown to those who deserve it, not to those who will repay it with harm.”</em></p>  <p>From that day on, Gopal became wiser. He continued to help others but was careful to <a href="/articles/help-people-to-recognize-the-physical-signs-of-stress-and-manage-the-stress.html" title="Read about Help People To Recognize The Physical Signs Of Stress And Manage The Stress">recognize</a> who truly deserved his kindness.</p>  <p><strong>Moral of the Story:</strong><br> <em>"Never trust someone who is inherently wicked, no matter how kindly you treat them."</em> Be kind, but also be wise in choosing whom to trust.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more quick reads read our peoples blog articles.</p></div>
