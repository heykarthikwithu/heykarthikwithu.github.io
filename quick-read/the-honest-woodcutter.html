                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a small village near a dense forest, there lived a poor but hardworking woodcutter named Harish. Every day, he would go into the forest, chop wood, and sell it in the market to earn a living. Though he had little, he was honest and content with what he earned.</p>  <p>One morning, Harish went to the forest as usual. He found a large, sturdy tree near a river and began chopping it down. As he swung his axe, his hands became sweaty, and suddenly, the axe slipped from his grip and fell into the deep river. Harish gasped in shock&mdash;his axe was his only means of livelihood!</p>  <p>Panicked, he tried to look into the river, but the water was too deep and fast-moving. He sat by the riverbank, feeling helpless and wondering how he would earn money without his axe. Unable to control his sorrow, he clasped his hands together and prayed, <em>&quot;Oh God, please help me! I have always been honest and hardworking. Without my axe, I will have nothing!&quot;</em></p>  <p>Just then, the water of the river started shimmering, and from its depths, a divine figure emerged. It was the river goddess! She smiled kindly at Harish and said, <em>&quot;Do not worry, dear woodcutter. I will help you.&quot;</em></p>  <p>She dived into the river and returned holding a magnificent golden axe, encrusted with jewels. She showed it to Harish and asked, <em>&quot;Is this your axe?&quot;</em></p>  <p>Harish was amazed by its beauty but shook his head and replied, <em>&quot;No, Goddess. This is not mine. My axe was made of simple iron.&quot;</em></p>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-1'> <p><em>Google Ad 1</em></p> </div>  <p>The goddess smiled at his honesty and went back into the water. This time, she returned with a silver axe. <em>&quot;Is this your axe?&quot;</em> she asked.</p>  <p>Harish looked at it carefully and again shook his head. <em>&quot;No, Goddess. My axe was not made of silver either. It was just an ordinary iron axe.&quot;</em></p>  <p>The goddess nodded and disappeared into the river once more. Finally, she came back holding Harish&rsquo;s simple iron axe. <em>&quot;Is this your axe?&quot;</em> she asked.</p>  <p>Harish&rsquo;s face lit up with relief and happiness. <em>&quot;Yes! Yes! This is my axe! Thank you, Goddess!&quot;</em> he exclaimed with joy.</p>  <p>Pleased with his honesty, the goddess said, <em>&quot;You are a truthful and good man. As a reward for your honesty, I will give you all three axes&mdash;the iron, the silver, and the golden one.&quot;</em></p>  <p>Harish was overjoyed. He bowed respectfully to the goddess and thanked her sincerely. He took the axes and returned to his village, where he told everyone what had happened. The villagers were amazed and praised Harish for his honesty.</p>  <p>Soon, the story of the honest woodcutter spread far and wide. People admired him, and he continued to live a simple yet happy life, always staying true to his values.</p>  <p><strong>Moral of the Story:</strong><br /> <em>&quot;Honesty is always rewarded.&quot;</em> Truthfulness and integrity bring great rewards, while dishonesty leads to loss. Always be honest, even when no one is watching!</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article,&nbsp;<a href='/quick-read/index.html'>for more quick reads</a>&nbsp;<a href='/articles/index.html'>read our peoples blog articles</a>.</p> </div>
