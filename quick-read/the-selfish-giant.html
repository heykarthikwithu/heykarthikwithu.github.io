                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a small village in India, there was a beautiful garden owned by a wealthy but selfish giant named Bhim Singh. The garden was full of colorful flowers, lush green grass, and tall fruit-bearing trees. Birds chirped joyfully, and <a href="/articles/cartesian-diver-science-experiment-for-children.html" title="Read about Cartesian Diver Science Experiment For Children">children</a> from the nearby village loved to come and play in the garden. Their laughter echoed all around, filling the garden with life.</p>  <p>But Bhim Singh, the giant, was a selfish man who hated noise and didn’t like to share. One day, he returned to his garden after a long journey and saw the children playing under his trees. Furious, he shouted, "This is my garden! No one is allowed here but me!"</p>  <p>He built a tall fence around the garden and hung a sign that read, <strong>"No Trespassing."</strong> The children, heartbroken, had no choice but to stop visiting. Without the laughter and joy of the children, the garden grew quiet and lifeless.</p>  <p>Seasons passed, but something strange began to happen. Spring stopped coming to the garden. The flowers refused to bloom, the trees stopped bearing fruit, and the grass withered. Instead, winter stayed all year round, with icy winds howling through the barren land.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, in the village, the children played elsewhere, but they always missed the giant's garden and its beauty. One morning, as Bhim Singh sat by his window, he heard the sound of laughter. Curious, he looked outside and saw a little boy sneaking through a hole in the fence. Soon, other children followed. The moment the children stepped into the garden, the flowers began to bloom, the trees blossomed, and birds returned to sing.</p>  <p>Bhim Singh finally realized his mistake. "My garden was beautiful because of the children’s joy," he thought. His heart softened as he watched them play, and he decided to make amends.</p>    <p>The next morning, Bhim Singh tore down the fence and invited the children back. "This garden belongs to all of you," he announced with a warm smile. The children cheered and ran into the garden, filling it once again with laughter and life.</p>  <p>Among the children, the giant noticed the little boy who had first sneaked in. He had an innocent face and a kind smile. The giant felt a special bond with the boy, but one day, the boy stopped coming to the garden. Bhim Singh searched everywhere but couldn’t find him.</p>  <p>Years passed, and Bhim Singh grew old. One winter morning, he looked outside and saw the same boy standing under a tree. The boy smiled and beckoned him. When the giant reached him, the boy said, "You have shared your garden and your heart with others. Now, it is time for you to come with me to a place of eternal spring."</p>  <p>Bhim Singh closed his eyes peacefully, and when the children came to play that day, they found the giant lying beneath the tree, smiling. His spirit had gone to a garden of endless beauty.</p>  <p><strong>Moral of the story:</strong> <strong>"Happiness grows when shared."</strong> Being selfish brings loneliness and sorrow, while sharing and kindness bring joy, love, and connection to life.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more quick reads read our peoples blog articles.</p></div>
