                                <div><p>Once upon a time, in a <a href="/articles/creativity-boosting-activities-to-have-a-peaceful-life.html" title="Read about Creativity Boosting Activities To Have A Peaceful Life">peaceful</a> village nestled among rolling hills, there lived a hardworking farmer named Janardhana. Janardhana had two sons, Deva and Madhava, who were known throughout the village for their laziness and lack of ambition.</p>  <p>Despite his best efforts to instill a strong work ethic in his sons, Janardhana watched with disappointment as Deva and Madhava whiled away their days lounging in the sun and avoiding any sort of meaningful labor.</p>  <p>One day, as Janardhana grew older and the burden of caring for the farm grew heavier, he called his sons to him and shared his concerns.</p>  <p>"<em>My dear sons</em>", Janardhana said, "<em>I fear that I am growing too old to tend to the farm on my own. It is time for you both to take on more responsibility and help me with the work</em>".</p>  <p>But Deva and Madhava only laughed at their father's words, dismissing his concerns with careless shrugs.</p>  <p>"<em>We have no interest in working on the farm, Father</em>", Deva said. "<em>We would much rather spend our days resting and enjoying ourselves</em>".</p>  <p>Disheartened by his sons refusal to help, Janardhana knew that he would need to come up with a clever plan to teach them the value of hard work and responsibility.</p>  <p>So, Janardhana devised a test for his sons. He called them to him once again and handed each of them a small sack of wheat.</p>    <p>"<em>I want you both to take these sacks of wheat and plant them in the field</em>", Janardhana said. "<em>Whoever can harvest the most wheat by the end of the month will inherit the farm and all its riches</em>".</p>  <p>Excited by the prospect of inheriting their father's wealth, Deva and Madhava eagerly set to work. But instead of planting the wheat in the field as their father had instructed, they simply tossed their sacks into the river and went back to their lazy ways.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, Janardhana secretly planted his own sack of wheat in the field and tended to it with care, watering it each day and watching it grow strong and tall.</p>  <p>As the end of the month approached, Deva and Madhava realized that they had made a grave mistake. When they saw the healthy crop of wheat growing in the field, they knew that their father had outsmarted them.</p>  <p>Ashamed of their laziness and deceit, Deva and Madhava begged their father for forgiveness and vowed to change their ways. Inspired by their father's hard work and determination, they joined him in tending to the farm and together they brought in a bountiful harvest that year.</p>  <p>From that day forth, Deva and Madhava learned the value of hard work and responsibility and they worked tirelessly alongside their father to ensure the success of the farm for generations to come.</p>  <p>The moral of the story is that hard work and dedication are the keys to success in life. Janardhana's clever test taught his sons an <a href="/articles/life-skills-that-are-important-for-future-stability.html" title="Read about Life Skills That Are Important For Future Stability">important</a> lesson about the importance of taking responsibility for their actions and working together as a family to achieve their goals.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more quick reads read our peoples blog articles.</p></div>
