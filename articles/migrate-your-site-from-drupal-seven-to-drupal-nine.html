                                <div><p>In this article, we are going to see <strong>what are the <a href="/articles/life-skills-that-are-important-for-future-stability.html" title="Read about Life Skills That Are Important For Future Stability">important</a> things</strong> you need to understand for the migration of your Drupal 7 site to the Drupal 9 site.</p> <p>And if you <strong>see from your Business perspective</strong>, Drupal 7 was launched nine years ago and this is the perfect time for some reassessment of the needs of site users and content managers.</p> <p>And if you see from Drupal’s end, Initially, Drupal 7 end of life was scheduled for November 2021, later it was extended to November 2022 and currently, <strong>Drupal 7 end of life is scheduled to November 2023.</strong></p> <p><strong>As a business</strong>, you will have many questions related to finding out the right people for your site migration from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. Here’s are the few things you need to get checked before you get your site for migration:</p> <ul class="check"> <li>Does your site is quite small with content, just you have is one type of content and users are searching for such content on your site?</li> <li>Does your site have one type of content and SEO is a priority for you?</li> <li>Does your site have <a href="/articles/create-related-content-different-content-types-through-taxonomy-drupal.html" title="Read about Create Related Content Different Content Types Through Taxonomy Drupal">different</a> types of content and different roles of users?</li> <li>Does your site have different types of content and different roles of users + with huge content in it?</li> <li>Does your site is with different types of content and users + different third-party integrations?</li> </ul> <p><strong>Effort and Time for Migration</strong> of your Drupal 7 to Drupal 9 depends on various such factors. And based on your case, you have to reach out to the right people. Here are a few consideration examples which you have a check to do this:</p> <ul class="check"> <li>For example, If your site has one type of content + one type of users and SEO is the priority. In this case, an Individual Drupal Expert or a small Pod of Drupal Experts can do this job for you. And Effort and Time for this can be 2 - 4 months roughly.</li> <li>For example, if your site is complex compared to the earlier example, then you might need a proper team of Architects, Tech leads, Drupal devs and QA to work on this.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>You have to understand one thing</strong>, Migration of Drupal 7 to Drupal 9 will not be pretty straightforward work. In 90 percent of the cases, the migration from Drupal 7 to Drupal 9 would be recreating the stuff (except the content migration)</p> <p><strong>From the Technical point</strong> of view, Drupal expert people can take up this, unless you have rare integrations and complex content structure in your site (which would need extra effort to sort such issues)</p> <p><strong>On the Other side</strong>, what happens if you don’t migrate?</p> <ul class="check"> <li>Since Drupal 7 is supported till November 2023, you would get support from Drupal for any security issue or any upgrades in contributed modules/themes.</li> <li>Drupal is moving towards Drupal 10, where migration Drupal 8 to 9 or 9 to 10 is pretty straightforward. But resources to pick Drupal 7 to Drupal 9 or 10 would be becoming less day by day (after Nov  2023)</li> <li>You will missout on the latest tech features in your site, which can be used by your site users and content managers.</li> </ul> <p>Hope you got some idea in regards to preparing <a href="/articles/growing-enough-tomatoes-to-feed-a-family-by-yourself.html" title="Read about Growing Enough Tomatoes To Feed A Family By Yourself">yourself</a> for your site Migration from Drupal 7 to Drupal 9.</p></div>

I contribute to PeoplesBLOG to share honest takes on everything from gadgets and digital tools to social issues and everyday experiences.</p><p>I’m curious by nature, detail-driven, and someone who likes to question things that don’t sit right. When I’m not writing or coding, you’ll probably find me on a motorcycle trip or working on a side project.</p>
