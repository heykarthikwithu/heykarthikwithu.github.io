                                <div><p><strong>Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh &ndash;</strong></p>  <p>What began as a tragic death inside a school hostel in 2017 has evolved into one of Andhra Pradesh&rsquo;s most haunting cases of alleged sexual assault, institutional failure, and delayed justice. The <strong>Sugali Preethi case</strong> continues to expose the cracks in India&rsquo;s system of investigation and accountability.</p>  <h2>The Incident &ndash; August 2017</h2>  <p>On the night of <strong>August 18, 2017</strong>, <strong>Sugali Preethi</strong>, a 16-year-old Class 10 student of <strong>Kattamanchi Ramalinga Reddy Residential School</strong> in <strong>Kurnool district</strong>, was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her hostel room.<br /> The school management claimed suicide. But her parents &mdash; <strong>Mr. Raju Naik</strong> and <strong>Mrs. Parvathi</strong>, members of a Scheduled Tribe community &mdash; immediately alleged <strong>sexual assault and murder</strong>, accusing the <strong>school correspondent V. Janardhan Reddy</strong> and his sons <strong>Diwakar Reddy</strong> and <strong>Harsha Vardhan Reddy</strong>.</p>  <p>The <strong>FIR No. 221/2017</strong> was filed at <strong>Kurnool Taluka Police Station</strong> under sections of <strong>rape (IPC 376)</strong> and <strong>murder (IPC 302)</strong>, along with provisions of the <strong>POCSO Act</strong>.<br /> However, despite the gravity of the allegations, the accused were <strong>released on bail within eight days</strong>, reportedly due to their political connections and local influence.</p>  <h2>Early Investigation and Irregularities</h2>  <p>Forensic reports reportedly detected <strong>multiple male DNA traces</strong> on the victim&rsquo;s body and clothes, contradicting the school&rsquo;s claim of suicide. Yet, the local investigation allegedly mishandled evidence &mdash; the hostel room was not sealed immediately, and the autopsy was delayed.</p>  <p>Human rights organizations, including the <strong>AP Girijana Sangham</strong> and several women&rsquo;s rights groups, staged protests demanding a <strong>CBI probe</strong>. The case was taken to the <strong>Andhra Pradesh High Court</strong>, with the parents seeking independent investigation.</p>  <h2>Political Promises and Broken Assurances</h2>  <p>In <strong>February 2020</strong>, the then YSRCP government issued <strong>G.O. No. 37</strong>, recommending a <strong>CBI investigation</strong>. The promise was welcomed but never implemented.<br /> When public anger rose again, <strong>Pawan Kalyan</strong>, then a prominent political leader and now the <strong>Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh</strong>, visited the family in Kurnool and <strong>promised a fresh probe and justice</strong>.</p>  <p>The victim&rsquo;s mother, <strong>Parvathi</strong>, later stated in several media interviews that <em>&ldquo;Pawan Kalyan promised justice in front of cameras, but no one ever returned to us once the cameras left.&rdquo;</em></p>  <p>Activists allege that between 2020 and 2024, <strong>no effective investigation</strong> was carried out. The <strong>CBI</strong> initially expressed its <strong>inability to take up the case</strong> in <strong>February 2025</strong>, citing lack of resources and jurisdictional scope.</p>  <h2>Revival Under the New Government</h2>  <p>In <strong>September 2025</strong>, under the <strong>Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP&ndash;JSP coalition government</strong>, a new <strong>Government Order (G.O. No. 114/2025)</strong> officially transferred the Sugali Preethi case to the <strong>Central Bureau of Investigation</strong>.<br /> Deputy CM <strong>Pawan Kalyan</strong>, facing renewed criticism from civil groups, reiterated that &ldquo;no one will be spared, regardless of influence,&rdquo; but the family remains cautious, saying <em>&ldquo;We have heard these words for eight years.&rdquo;</em></p>  <p>The CBI has reportedly re-registered the case under its Hyderabad unit in <strong>October 2025</strong>, calling for all earlier files, evidence, and forensic materials to be resubmitted.</p>  <h2>The Family&rsquo;s Struggle</h2>  <p>For eight years, the family has lived under constant intimidation. The victim&rsquo;s mother, <strong>Parvathi</strong>, continues to demand that the <strong>school be blacklisted</strong> and that <strong>all witnesses</strong> who retracted statements under pressure be re-examined.<br /> Several tribal and Dalit organizations have joined her protest, claiming that <em>&ldquo;justice delayed for a tribal girl is justice denied for an entire community.&rdquo;</em></p>  <h2>Patterns in Similar Cases</h2>  <p>The Sugali Preethi case is not an isolated tragedy. India has seen several hostel and institutional deaths where investigations were delayed or derailed:</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Delta Meghwal Case (2016, Rajasthan)</strong> &ndash; A 17-year-old Dalit student was found dead in a hostel tank after alleged rape. Convictions came <strong>five years later</strong>, only after relentless public pressure.</li> <li><strong>Aarushi Talwar Case (2008, Noida)</strong> &ndash; Despite national attention and a CBI probe, contradictory evidence led to acquittals and <strong>no definitive closure</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Fathima Latheef Case (2019, IIT Madras)</strong> &ndash; Allegations of harassment were raised, but the case stalled without conclusive outcomes.</li> </ul>  <p>Experts note that <strong>political interference</strong>, <strong>poor evidence handling</strong>, and <strong>delays in forensic analysis</strong> are recurring features in such cases &mdash; especially when the accused are powerful or well-connected.</p>  <h2>Speculation and Systemic Issues</h2>  <p>Legal analysts believe that the <strong>initial missteps</strong> in 2017 may have permanently weakened the case. Unsealed evidence, early bail, and shifting political priorities allowed the accused to remain free.<br /> Social activists speculate that &ldquo;missing CCTV footage&rdquo; and &ldquo;pressure on police officers&rdquo; prevented early breakthroughs.</p>  <p>A retired senior CBI officer, speaking anonymously, stated:</p>  <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;By the time CBI takes up such cases, vital traces are gone. We end up rebuilding an investigation from ashes.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>  <h2>Public Reaction and Ongoing Pressure</h2>  <p>Across Andhra Pradesh, hashtags like <strong>#JusticeForSugaliPreethi</strong> and <strong>#CBIForPreethi</strong> trend periodically whenever there is a political statement.<br /> Student organizations and civil rights groups continue to demand:</p>  <ol> <li><strong>Public release of investigation status reports</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Accountability for officers</strong> who delayed or mishandled evidence.</li> <li><strong>Protection for the victim&rsquo;s family and witnesses.</strong></li> </ol>  <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>  <p>As of <strong>October 2025</strong>, the <strong>CBI investigation</strong> is officially active. Officers from the <strong>Hyderabad zone</strong> have begun reviewing prior case diaries and forensic reports.<br /> However, legal experts warn that without <strong>fresh forensic reconstruction</strong> or <strong>new witness testimony</strong>, conviction may remain elusive.</p>  <h2>Lessons and Reflections</h2>  <p>The Sugali Preethi case exposes a harsh truth: <strong>justice in India often depends on persistence rather than process</strong>.<br /> Eight years after her death, the family&rsquo;s wait continues &mdash; not for sympathy, but for accountability.</p>  <p>As one activist put it:</p>  <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;If a 16-year-old girl&rsquo;s death inside a government-aided school cannot find justice even after eight years, what message are we sending to every other girl in this country?&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  <p>The story of Sugali Preethi is more than a criminal case &mdash; it is a mirror to systemic apathy. Whether the <strong>CBI&rsquo;s renewed probe in 2025</strong> will finally break the cycle of neglect remains uncertain.<br /> For now, her name stands as a symbol &mdash; of courage, grief, and the unending fight for justice.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article,&nbsp;<a href='/articles/index.html'>read out articles for more such articles</a>.</p> </div>
