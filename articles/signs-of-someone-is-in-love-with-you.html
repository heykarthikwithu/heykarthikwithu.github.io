I contribute to PeoplesBLOG to share honest takes on everything from gadgets and digital tools to social issues and everyday experiences.</p><p>I’m curious by nature, detail-driven, and someone who likes to question things that don’t sit right. When I’m not writing or coding, you’ll probably find me on a motorcycle trip or working on a side project.</p>
