                                <div><p>Water is not just a natural resource for Pakistan&mdash;it is its lifeline. With over 90% of its water supply coming from a single river system, Pakistan is critically dependent on external sources. Agriculture, power generation, and daily life across the country rely on uninterrupted water flow, primarily from rivers originating in Indian-administered territory. In recent developments, however, the very <a href='/articles/vedic-philosophy-the-foundation-of-indian-thought.html' title='Read about Vedic Philosophy The Foundation Of Indian Thought'>foundation</a> of this supply has come under threat.</p>  <h2>Where Does Pakistan&rsquo;s Water Come From?</h2>  <p><strong>1. The Indus River System</strong></p>  <p>Pakistan&rsquo;s surface water is almost entirely fed by the <strong>Indus River System</strong>, which originates from the Tibetan Plateau and flows through Indian-administered Jammu &amp; Kashmir before entering Pakistan. Its major tributaries include the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers.</p>  <p>This system was previously regulated under the <strong>Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)</strong> of 1960. Under this agreement:</p>  <ul> <li>Pakistan was allocated the <strong>western rivers</strong>: Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab.</li> <li>India retained the <strong>eastern rivers</strong>: Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej.</li> </ul>  <p>Pakistan depended heavily on this framework, receiving over 80% of its surface water from rivers that originated in India.</p>  <p><strong>2. Glacial Sources</strong></p>  <p>The rivers are fed by meltwater from thousands of glaciers in the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges. These glaciers act as a seasonal reserve, but their stability is declining due to rising global temperatures. Rapid glacial melt and shifting snowfall patterns have introduced volatility to river flows, creating uncertainty around long-term water availability.</p>  <p><strong>3. Rainfall and Groundwater</strong></p>  <p>Rainfall plays a minor and inconsistent role. Groundwater has become a secondary source in Pakistan, but is being depleted at an unsustainable rate. In Punjab and Sindh, heavy extraction is leading to water table decline and increasing salinity&mdash;threatening both crop yields and drinking water.</p>  <h2>India&rsquo;s Role in Pakistan&rsquo;s Water Security</h2>  <p>Due to geography, India sits upstream of all major rivers that supply Pakistan. For decades, the Indus Waters Treaty ensured a predictable flow of water across the border. Despite multiple conflicts, the treaty endured and was seen as a cornerstone of stability&mdash;until 2025.</p>  <p>India built several run-of-the-river hydropower projects on rivers allocated to Pakistan, within treaty limits. These were contested but resolved through legal mechanisms or arbitration. Still, Pakistan&rsquo;s reliance on Indian-administered rivers has remained absolute.</p>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-1'> <p>Google Ad 1</p> </div>  <h2>Post-2025 Shift: Pahalgam Attack, Operation Sindhoor &amp; Treaty Suspension</h2>  <p>On <strong>April 22, 2025</strong>, a terrorist attack occurred in the Baisaran valley near Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. Terrorists, disguised in army fatigues, targeted a group of tourists, resulting in the deaths of <strong>26 civilians</strong>, primarily Hindu tourists, and injuries to 17 others. The assailants reportedly asked victims to recite Islamic verses, executing those who failed to comply. The attackers fled the scene, and <strong>The Resistance Front&nbsp;(TRF)</strong> group officially claimed responsibility &amp; four days later retracted their claim of responsibility. However, Indian authorities attributed the attack to <strong>Pakistan-based terrorist <a href='/articles/why-is-drupal-chosen-by-large-organizations.html' title='Read about Why Is Drupal Chosen By Large Organizations'>organizations</a></strong>, notably <strong>Lashkar-e-Taiba</strong> and <strong>Jaish-e-Mohammed</strong>.</p>  <p>In response to this incident, on <strong>April 23, 2025</strong>, the <strong>Government of India suspended</strong> the Indus Waters Treaty, citing ongoing security concerns and Pakistan&rsquo;s role in supporting cross-border terrorism. This historic move marked the <strong>first time India suspended a major <a href='/articles/international-mother-language-day.html' title='Read about International Mother Language Day'>international</a> water-sharing agreement</strong>, a decision that has led to severe repercussions for Pakistan.</p>  <p>And, on <strong>May 7, 2025</strong>, India launched <strong>Operation Sindoor</strong>, a series of missile strikes targeting what it identified as terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The operation aimed at nine locations associated with the aforementioned militant groups. India described the strikes as &quot;focused, measured, and non-escalatory,&quot; asserting that no Pakistani military facilities were targeted.</p>  <h2>Impact on Pakistan</h2>  <p>The effects of the suspension were immediate:</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Water shortages</strong> hit Punjab and Sindh during the early irrigation season.</li> <li><strong>Tarbela and Mangla dams</strong> saw drastic reductions in inflow, forcing cuts in electricity generation.</li> <li>Cities like <strong>Lahore and Karachi</strong> began experiencing low water pressure and disrupted supplies.</li> <li>The <strong>Kharif planting season</strong> suffered due to lack of water for rice and sugarcane crops.</li> <li><strong>Food prices surged</strong>, and the government was forced to <strong>import grain and fuel</strong>, placing pressure on foreign reserves.</li> </ul>  <p>Pakistan, long reliant on upstream cooperation, now faced the reality of a <strong>restricted and uncertain water supply</strong>.</p>  <h2>India Holds the Tap</h2>  <p>With the treaty suspended, Pakistan no longer has a formal mechanism to ensure water delivery from rivers originating in India. Any flow into Pakistan now depends <strong>entirely on India&#39;s decisions</strong>&mdash;based on its domestic needs, security policy, and geopolitical considerations.</p>  <p>Calls for mediation or international intervention have gained no traction. There is <strong>no enforcement mechanism</strong> outside the treaty, and <strong>India currently holds full control</strong> over how much water reaches Pakistan. This new status quo has introduced a dangerous asymmetry&mdash;<strong>one in which Pakistan waits, but only India decides</strong>.</p>  <h2>Conclusion: A <a href='/articles/national-education-policy-nep.html' title='Read about National Education Policy Nep'>National</a> Wake-Up Call</h2>  <p>Pakistan&rsquo;s water crisis is no longer hypothetical. It is unfolding in real time. The suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has revealed the extent of Pakistan&rsquo;s dependency and vulnerability. Without upstream access and with no viable alternative in place, Pakistan&rsquo;s future water supply now hinges on a neighbor that controls the source&mdash;and the tap.</p>  <p>This is a wake-up call: for self-reliance, for internal reform, and for urgent adaptation. The survival of Pakistan&rsquo;s agriculture, cities, and energy sector depends not just on rainfall or reservoirs&mdash;but on the political will of a country beyond its borders.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article,&nbsp;read out articles for more such articles.</p> </div>
