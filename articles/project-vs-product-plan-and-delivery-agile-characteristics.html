At this stage business needs might be X and after a few months business needs might be Y (some tech is older or some new tech came up). This might not work with the ideology of Project but this will work with the ideology of Product (in one word Agile).</li> <li>Delivery of the MVP to the Client is on <strong>stage of success</strong> of the work planned. Again to achieve this, we need to consider as a Product (additionally track it as project)</li> </ol>    <p>Other <strong><a href="/articles/life-skills-that-are-important-for-future-stability.html" title="Read about Life Skills That Are Important For Future Stability">important</a> thing</strong>, It is not really needed to show the details of how we track work as a project with the Clients, but If we are providing the details at end of every sprint, It helps both Service providers and Clients the confidence of how the work is going on and it is expected to finish as planned.</p>  <p>I have articulated some kind of tips while working with the Agile process, Hope this will help or get some thoughts around the process, while you read the article. To summarize, in layman terms, While service providers following Agile, treat the work as Product. At the same time track it down as a project (at least internally). Thanks for reading the article, for more such related articles read our people blog articles.</p></div>

I contribute to PeoplesBLOG to share honest takes on everything from gadgets and digital tools to social issues and everyday experiences.</p><p>I’m curious by nature, detail-driven, and someone who likes to question things that don’t sit right. When I’m not writing or coding, you’ll probably find me on a motorcycle trip or working on a side project.</p>
