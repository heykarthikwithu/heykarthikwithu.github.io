                                <div><p>In this article we are gonna see eight vegetables that you can grow at your home easily. Chili pepper, Tomato, Garlic, Peas, Raddish, Cabbage, Cauliflower and Carrot are the few vegetables that you can grow at home with less effort.</p>  <p><strong>1. Chili pepper</strong></p>  <p>Chili pepper can be easily grown from seeds, so we need to buy good seeds for better results. Sprinkle seeds over the soil surface, then cover with a fine layer of the same soil.</p>  <p>Transplant the seedlings once they are 4 to 5 inches tall or have 6 to 8 leaves, make sure to take seedlings out the root ball intact to avoid any transplant issues.</p>  <p>Make a 2 to 3 inch deep hole in the soil, gently place the root ball in the middle and fill the soil, make sure to plant them in groups, it will help better pollination.</p>  <p>5 to 7 hours of sunlight is needed every day. For more branches cut the tip of the plants after 8 to 10 days of transplant.</p>  <p>You can easily tell when they are ready for harvesting by seeing it.</p>  <p><strong>2. Tomato </strong></p>  <p>Plant the seedlings when they are 5 to 6 inches long, remove the bottom leaves and plant them as deep as possible. Deep planting tomato seedlings will help them grow better.</p>  <p>As plants grow tall provide support, use sticks for the support of the plant and tie the stems loosely to the stick which is kept for support.</p>  <p>After 15 to 20 days add more nutrient composite, because tomato plants need more to produce well.</p>  <p>Within 35 to 40 days you will start seeing the fruit appearing and You can easily tell when they are ready for harvesting by seeing it.</p>    <p><strong>3. Garlic</strong></p>  <p>Garlic needs sandy soil (river soil) for healthy growth. Pick the largest pulp for the planting, because they will have the best chance of sprouting.</p>  <p>While planting, place the clove to the bottom into the soil and flat ending part above the soil. And water it well.</p>  <p>5 to 7 hours of sunlight is needed every day. Every 15 days dig up the top layer of the soil to keep fluffy, so that bulbs grow big in size. Water only when soil is dry, avoid wet <a href="/articles/how-hereditary-conditions-are-diagnosed-and-managed.html" title="Read about How Hereditary Conditions Are Diagnosed And Managed">conditions</a>.</p>  <p>Once the leaves are turning brown and in dead state, this is the time to harvest the Garlic. On harvesting, keep them to dry for some time.</p>  <p><strong>4. Peas</strong></p>  <p>Peas are perfect vegetables to grow in containers, soaking the seeds before planting will make the germination process quick.</p>  <p>Plant the seeds in the containers, they grow quickly and don’t need much attention, they need full sunlight and soil needs to be kept moist.</p><div class="google-ad" id="google-ad-1"><p>Google Ad 1</p></div>  <p>As plants grow, create a support <a href="/articles/vedic-sanskrit-language-and-structure.html" title="Read about Vedic Sanskrit Language And Structure">structure</a> with the help of sticks. Add compost every 15 days for better growth.</p>  <p>Peas will often have issues with insects and disease and are generally ready to eat about three weeks after they start to flower.</p>  <p>Harvest as soon as they are plump and ripe, if they are left to peak, then they lose their sweetness.</p>  <p><strong>5. Raddish</strong></p>  <p>Radishes are one of the fastest growing vegetables, <a href="/articles/different-ways-to-get-more-out-of-six-nine-position.html" title="Read about Different Ways To Get More Out Of Six Nine Position">different</a> varieties are available in the market. </p>  <p>They don’t do well with transplants so sprinkle seeds in a container assuming you are not transplanting them.</p>  <p>Well drained, loose soil will be good for the root vegetables, mix river sand to get better results.</p>  <p>Keep the soil evenly moist, watering frequently will result in quick growth.</p>  <p>Harvest them, when the root is more than 2 to 3 inches larger. You will get to know the harvest time by the leaves it has grown.</p>    <p><strong>6. Cabbage and Cauliflower</strong></p>  <p>Cabbage and Cauliflower belong to the same family, start them with seeds.</p>  <p>Transplant the seedlings, when they are 4 to 5 inches tall and 4 to 5 leaves. Keep 6 to 8 inches of gap between the seedlings during the transplant for healthy growth.</p>  <p>They need 5 to 7 hours of sunlight for healthy growth and head formation. Water well after transplanting to avoid transplant shock. Add compost for every 18 days for better growth.</p>  <p>Cut the whole head from the main stem, the matured head should be compact and firm.</p>  <p><strong>7. Carrot</strong></p>  <p>Carrots are quite similar to radish for growing. Sprinkle seeds in a container assuming you are not transplanting them. On germination of seeds, pluck out the seedlings which are very nearby.</p>  <p>Well drained, loose soil will be good for the root vegetables, mix river sand to get better results. Keep the soil evenly moist, watering frequently will result in quick growth. Add compost for every 20 days for better growth.</p>  <p>Most of the carrot varieties are ready to harvest in 60 to 70 days, you will get to know the harvest time by the leaves it has grown.</p>  <p>Here are the vegetables to grow at your home and this will be helpful for people who wish to grow their food for their family and for people who have time for growing at home. Also a good hobby. If you have a hobby of growing such vegetables at home, do continue by reading related articles in Peoples BLOG.
