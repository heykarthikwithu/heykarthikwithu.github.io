Good or bad friends, it is the name that we give for our interactions and conversations that we had with them which tells good or bad and not about the person to be specific.</p>  <p>Few friends are the casual type like you could share some interests with them, talk sometimes but it is not deep friendship as it was to be. Few others are close like you spend time with them whenever you can, <a href='/articles/improvements-for-editor-experience-in-drupal.html' title='Read about Improvements For Editor Experience In Drupal'>experience</a> ups and downs and yet remain good friends of yours.

Remember that we don&rsquo;t know which good friends that we make today will turn out to be friends for life.</p>  <p>Similarities exist as well as differences between friends, that&rsquo;s what helps in keeping the bond alive.</p>  <p>How much ever we get busy with life, taking out time for the ones who made us smile when we needed one, are referred to as friends maybe.</p>  <p>Friends, old or new, will continue to shape us into our better selves.
