Good or bad friends, it is the name that we give for our interactions and conversations that we had with them which tells good or bad and not about the person to be specific.</span></p>  <p><span style='color:#f39c12'>Few friends are the casual type like you could share some interests with them, talk sometimes but it is not deep friendship as it was to be. Few others are close like you spend time with them whenever you can, experience ups and downs and yet remain good friends of yours. Sometimes it happens like the two of you won&rsquo;t talk for some time, but once started again, it feels like you have never been apart. You feel secure in such friendships.</span></p>  <p><span style='color:#3498db'>Few friends help us to improve our emotional well-being, with whom although you never recognized them as close as other friends. Such friendships are born at the time when your emotions are taken care of rather than mere situations.</span></p>  <p><span style='color:#f39c12'>Few of such bonds would have started with defining profound moments.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style='color:#3498db'>Few others are smaller gestures that make a difference like who talks when you need someone to talk to, who listens to us patiently without judging and someone who can finish your sentences and vice versa.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style='color:#f39c12'>There should exist clear communication and mutual trust between friends, which forms a basis for a long-lasting friendship.</span></p>  <div class='google-ad'>     <ins class='adsbygoogle'          style='display:block; text-align:center;'          data-ad-layout='in-article'          data-ad-format='fluid'          data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'          data-ad-slot='4812668708'></ins>     <script>         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     </script> </div>  <p><span style='color:#3498db'>These interactions with others make us feel good about ourselves, enhance our self-esteem,&nbsp; keep our minds sharp and in a way push us forward in life to take challenges as they come.</span></p>  <p><span style='color:#f39c12'>We should try to seek good in others and be respectful in each interaction. Remember that we don&rsquo;t know which good friends that we make today will turn out to be friends for life.</span></p>  <p><span style='color:#3498db'>Similarities exist as well as differences between friends, that&rsquo;s what helps in keeping the bond alive.</span></p>  <p><span style='color:#f39c12'>How much ever we get busy with life, taking out time for the ones who made us smile when we needed one, are referred to as friends maybe.</span></p>  <p><span style='color:#3498db'>Friends, old or new, will continue to shape us into our better selves. It is a thing to be cherished and kept for a lifetime.</span></p>  <p><span style='color:#f39c12'>To end, Sometimes friends grow apart, changing life paths and dimensions, so does everyone, all come and go, keep on good terms till you have got one.</span></p></div>
