Good or bad friends, it is the name that we give for our interactions and conversations that we had with them which tells good or bad and not about the person to be specific.</p>  <p>Few friends are the casual type like you could share some interests with them, talk sometimes but it is not deep friendship as it was to be. Few others are close like you spend time with them whenever you can, <a href='/articles/improvements-for-editor-experience-in-drupal.html' title='Read about Improvements For Editor Experience In Drupal'>experience</a> ups and downs and yet remain good friends of yours.
