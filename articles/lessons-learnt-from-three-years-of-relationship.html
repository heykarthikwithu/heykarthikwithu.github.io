                                <div><p>Living together for almost <strong>three years is a good amount of journey in your life</strong>. For me atleast like, part of me feels like time is absolutely flying and the other half feels like we have been married for three years. <strong>We have certainly not been perfect, but</strong> I'm gonna share fews lessons which I learnt out of these three years which I spent in my <a href="/articles/how-do-you-know-if-you-are-emotionally-neglecting-your-partner-in-a-relationship.html" title="Read about How Do You Know If You Are Emotionally Neglecting Your Partner In A Relationship">relationship</a>.</p>                            <h4>1. <a href="/articles/the-importance-of-post-surgical-rehabilitation-programs.html" title="Read about The Importance Of Post Surgical Rehabilitation Programs">Importance</a> of a quick vacation</h4>                            <p>We made a big list of places to travel and see.. Actually <strong>travel is one thing which we both agree on and do</strong>.. Sometimes even if it's a one day trip in and around the city, it will take us back to the level up phase.. We always come back, feeling more connected.</p>                            <h4>2. Your flexibility &amp; vulnerability</h4>                            <ul class="check">                                <li>Once you start living with a person, you will feel flexible by sharing your routine work.. I mean, <strong>how good does it feel if your routine work is done by your partner?</strong> (other than your Mom of course).</li>                                <li>And, You be able to tell your partner something like <strong>"I really feel... xyz...", Where xyz is completely open and without any hidden agenda</strong>. This will be the hardest thing initially, but you are vulnerable with your partner means you are doing great in your relationship.</li>                            </ul>                            <h4>3. Always Negotiation</h4>                            <p>You will learn What is Negotiation? (if you had not done it earlier). <strong>For everything you do along with your partner you start negotiating</strong>. Sometimes you win and sometimes you let your partner win - But you will enjoy it.</p>                                                        <h4>4. Don't Debate right before going to Bed</h4>                            <p>This is one of the worst things, <strong>I recommend not to do. Why?</strong> Sometimes, You might have already done for the day &amp; your brain will not be in a position to listen (A tired Brain). Instead, I suggest having a word and discussing later in the day.</p>                            <h4>5. Relationship is always a WIP (Work In Progress)</h4>                            <p>You will always be having a challenge in your relationship like, initially managing work at home, mingling with people.. later travelling, buying a home etc.. <strong>There's no endpoint. You have to treat your relationship like a learning experience</strong>, where perfection is not the goal.</p>                            <h4>6. Keep learning new ways, to keep things romantic</h4>                            <p>Yeah, you should keep learning! I mean, Initially you might be getting flowers as a romantic gesture.. After sometime your partner herself gets flowers.. You know what i mean, Even if you get flowers now, <strong>you both might be missing that romantic gesture which you had earlier</strong>.. So it's better to start doing new things like Cooking dinner or something as a romantic gesture..</p>                            <p>Finally, When you're single, you get used to being selfish because there's only you.</p>                            <p>In a relationship it's about more than your own selfish desires. <strong>A relationship means you live together and make time for each other</strong>.</p></div>
