                                <div><p>Recently I had to attend a virtual session by Transformation Coach and a Psychologist. Where in the session, she was saying about how one can take charge of their own life.. by being confident! It was a great session.. started with, Do you often feel that you have no control over your life? Do you feel that you are just drifting day after day, without any goal and direction?. It was really nice to think of a situation or a feeling like that.</p>                                <p>After that entire day. Sometime in the evening, I've recalled the session and few of them were their in my head.. like,</p>                                <ul class="check">                                    <li>Dealing with Negative <a href="/articles/how-to-express-thoughts-without-hurting-other-people.html" title="Read about How To Express Thoughts Without Hurting Other People">Thoughts</a></li>                                    <li>Self Discipline</li>                                    <li>Passive vs Assertive behaviour</li>                                    <li>Learn to say NO!</li>                                </ul>                                <p>Actually during the session, she has shared few more things.. but, I've only few in my head..</p>                                <h3>Dealing with Negative Thoughts</h3>                                <p>So, She had an example,</p>                                <p>"A white paper and a black dot in it", And asked audience what we saw in it..</p>                                <p>What she was explaining is.. "What to see! and What not to see!"</p>                                <p>What i've understood is, We get into many situations every day, we should deal every situation confidently and at the same time just don't look at the negative side of situation instead prepare for it positively.</p>                                <h3>Self Discipline</h3>                                <p>Their was an example shared by her, which i forgot.. But, what i understood with her explaination was, we should create a plan and stick to the plan. And If needed change the plan according as we need.</p>                                <p>This applies to everything, may be its daily activity, its daily work or any thing which we had to do.</p>                                <p>So, be self-disciplined and you will be confident.</p>                                <h3>Passive vs Assertive behaviour</h3>                                <p>She had an example,</p>                                <p>"You have given your car in garage for service and returned home, you had said to mechanic, to check and tell the cost.. But After few hours, the mechanic is done with service and hands you with 10K bill".</p>                                <p>How do you deal with it..?</p>                                <p>What she was explaining is,</p>                                <p>We should deal the situation assertively. and Talk to the mechanic, with the details of service and close the discussion based on the satisfaction.</p>                                <p>At the same time, we should not be passive.. Means, pay the bill and not going to that service guy next time.</p>                                <p>So, being assertive in our behaviour, makes us more confident.</p>                                <h3>Learn to say NO!</h3>                                <p>I don't know from where if got this! But after that session, I had this also in my head.. may be my sub-consious got to..</p>                                <p>I don't have much to say on this.. But, we should learn to say "No" for helping other everytime, instead you can teach them for once.</p>                                <p>A great quote says, <sup><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i></sup> Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime <sup><i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></sup></p>                                <p>So, this was all in this article of taking charge of your life by being <a href="/articles/growing-enough-onions-to-feed-a-family-by-yourself.html" title="Read about Growing Enough Onions To Feed A Family By Yourself">yourself</a> confident..</p></div>
