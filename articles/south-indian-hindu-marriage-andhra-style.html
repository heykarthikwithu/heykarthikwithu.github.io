                                <div><p>South Indian weddings are traditionally going to be planned or happen for one or more than a day, which involve having mehndi for the bride particularly, in some cases times groom as well have mehndi. Few of the south Indians have Haldi ceremonies as well. Groom's arrival itself is celebrated. And the wedding ceremony begins with a few pooja’s & traditions. And at the end, the couple will be sent to Groom’s house as a goodbye ceremony.</p>                                <p>Let me detail it out as a process or steps which South Indians Hindus follow in their marriage. Specifically in Andhra (telugu) traditions & rituals are done as below. And mostly in south india, Hindus will have more or less similar traditions & rituals.</p>                                <p>And to make a note, few traditions will happen in Groom's home, few at Bride’s home and few at Wedding place.</p>                                <h3>1.

Bride’s home</h3>                                <p><strong>Applying Mehendi to Bride</strong>: This is the tradition in which mehndi is applied to Bride’s hands and legs.</p>                                <p><strong>Haldi Ceremony</strong> is done by applying haldi to Bride by a few married women and an auspicious bath is taken by Bride; this itself is a ritual done before making an official Bride.</p>                                <p><strong>Officially making her Bride</strong>, by taking blessings of elderly people at home, relatives & friends. And start with pooja.</p>                                <p><strong>Ganesh & Gouri pooja at home</strong> is done by the Bride.</p>                                <div class="google-ad">                                    <!-- script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-2683569506254139"                                            crossorigin="anonymous"></script -->                                    <ins class="adsbygoogle"                                         style="display:block; text-align:center;"                                         data-ad-layout="in-article"                                         data-ad-format="fluid"                                         data-ad-client="ca-pub-2683569506254139"                                         data-ad-slot="4812668708"></ins>                                    <script>                                        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});                                    </script>                                </div>                                <h3>3.
