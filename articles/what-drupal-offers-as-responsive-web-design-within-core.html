                                <div><p>In this article, we gonna see What Drupal offers as <a href="/articles/what-drupal-offers-as-responsive-web-design-within-core.html" title="Read about What Drupal Offers As Responsive Web Design Within Core">Responsive</a> Web Design within Drupal Core for developers. While Drupal 8 was out and it had a buzz of being <strong>responsive</strong>, <strong>mobile <a href="/articles/how-to-be-approachable-and-friendly.html" title="Read about How To Be Approachable And Friendly">friendly</a></strong>. And yes, the Internet is on the verge of being dominated by smartphones &amp; Drupal needs to be prepared.</p><p>Mobile friendly will also mean <strong>the content is first</strong>. From a big screen to a little screen, elements would look <a href="/articles/create-related-content-different-content-types-through-taxonomy-drupal.html" title="Read about Create Related Content Different Content Types Through Taxonomy Drupal">different</a>, Images would be responsive, menu items would render as drop-downs, columns are moved to top/bottom based on flexibility of view on different screens.</p><p>If <strong>Drupal is providing mobile friendly means</strong>, one should be able to use it as 100% responsive with at least the core drupal code. Let’s take a closer look at what Drupal is providing to say itself as Responsive web design.</p><h3>Just Drupal Core</h3><p>With fresh Drupal you get <strong>Bartik</strong> as front end theme &amp; Seven as the admin theme where both the themes are really responsive. In one word if you wanna say, one can manage content from the mobile device with <strong>Seven</strong> theme. As long as you are just adding content then you are good to go with Seven &amp; Bartik.</p><h3>Modules in Drupal Core</h3><p>We have two modules in the Drupal core, <strong>Breakpoint</strong> and <strong>Responsive Image</strong> which are making the site responsive. On fresh drupal installation you can see the Breakpoint module already enabled which will help the admin toolbar to be responsive.</p><p>Breakpoint module will provide the ability to make the site <strong>change at different screen sizes</strong>. This module will provide a <strong>way to identify and use the breakpoints</strong>, based on this the front end developers and site builders can make the site look more responsive.</p><p>Even though we have a way to define breakpoints for our theme, we still need to do something for images to look responsive. And for this Responsive Image module can be enabled.</p><p>Responsive Image module requires Breakpoint module to be enabled, because it uses the breakpoints that are defined in the theme along with image styles.</p><p>In the older version of Drupal, there was a module called Picture, which was helping to create responsive images. Now this module is the same as a Responsive image module. And there is still configuration that must be set up for the Responsive image module, but unlike Breakpoint there is a user interface to do your configuration. </p><p>These are responsive design benifits would be available from the Drupal Core. Thanks to that, Drupal CMS is more responsive and provides better efficiency for Content teams.</p></div>

I contribute to PeoplesBLOG to share honest takes on everything from gadgets and digital tools to social issues and everyday experiences.</p><p>I’m curious by nature, detail-driven, and someone who likes to question things that don’t sit right. When I’m not writing or coding, you’ll probably find me on a motorcycle trip or working on a side project.</p>
