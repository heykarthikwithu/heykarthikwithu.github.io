                                <div><p>The Finance Minister has announced in <strong>Union Budget of India for 2021-22</strong>, that two Public Sector Banks (PSBs) will be Privatised. The policy of government in last three decades of economic reforms was to sell a part of shares in Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) including PSBs to public while retaining the controlling share in its own hands.</p>                                <p><strong><a href="/articles/privatisation-of-public-sector-banks-banks-strike-march-.html" title="Read about Privatisation Of Public Sector Banks Banks Strike March">Privatisation</a> of PSBs is important because government has been investing huge amounts in them every year in last decade to keep these banks from collapsing</strong>. This is called "capitalisation" of banks, that is, augmenting the capital to compensate for the losses incurred by them.</p>                                <ul class="check1">                                    <li>One aspect of this investment is to <strong>bring the capital of PSBs in line with international norms</strong>.</li>                                    <li>The other aspect is that this investment <strong>covers up losses incurred by these PSBs</strong>.</li>                                    <li>More capital is required because <strong>they have incurred losses and their <a href="/articles/code-profiling-and-performance-optimization-of-an-existing-php-project.html" title="Read about Code Profiling And Performance Optimization Of An Existing Php Project">existing</a> capital has been wiped off</strong>.</li>                                </ul>                                <p>The <strong>first criticism</strong> of this step is that money earned from privatisation will be used to support increasing <a href="/articles/how-to-simplify-your-life-with-mindful-consumption.html" title="Read about How To Simplify Your Life With Mindful Consumption">consumption</a> expenditures of government such as paying higher salaries and dearness allowance to its employees. <strong>This criticism is only partially correct</strong>.</p>                                <p>The <strong>second criticism</strong> of privatisation is that government is stepping back from its responsibilities of "Welfare State". The <strong>banks were nationalised in 1971</strong> with the idea that private banks were not serving rural areas and the poorer sections of society. They were nationalised <strong>so that they could be directed to open branches in rural areas and provide loans</strong> to priority sectors.</p>                                <ul class="check1">                                    <li>Truly speaking, it was <strong>not necessary to nationalise the banks in order to provide banking services</strong> to the rural areas.</li>                                    <li>The Reserve Bank of India <strong>(RBI) had adequate powers to direct the private banks to open branches</strong> in the specified backward areas.</li>                                </ul>                                <p>The <strong>third criticism</strong> of privatisation is that <strong>private banks indulge in giving loans to the sister concerns</strong> of their owners. <strong>This is correct. However, the same problem exists in the PSBs</strong>. They provide loans to doubtful entities at the asking of the Secretaries and the Ministers coupled with corruption by the bank officials.</p>                                <p>The <strong>Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) of PSBs have arisen in large measure due to such lending</strong>. The problem of "bad" lending, therefore, has no relation with the lender being a PSBs or a private bank</p>                                <p><strong>Both can equally be at fault</strong>. The solution of this problem, again, is for the <strong>RBI to vigilantly track the lending portfolios</strong> of the private banks and <strong>take proactive steps when they indulge in lending</strong> to their sister concerns or doubt about the viability of the borrowers emerge</p>                                <p>And, Finance Minister of India</p>                                <ul class="check1">                                    <li><strong>Has to be congratulated</strong> that she had decided to privatise two PSBs.</li>                                    <li><strong>Should move fast and take steps to privatise the major PSBs</strong>. The stock market conditions are favourable at present.</li>                                    <li><strong>Must use the present buoyancy in the stock market to privatise the larger PSBs</strong>. That will provide the much-needed revenues to meet the contingencies arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic.</li>                                </ul>                                <p>The additional receipts from <strong>privatisation should be used to make public investments in new areas such as genetics, big data and space research</strong>. This will lay the foundations of our technological prowess of India in the coming decades.</p></div>
