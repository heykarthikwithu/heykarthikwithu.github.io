                                <div><p><strong>New Delhi&mdash;</strong> The Union government has introduced the <em>Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025</em>, a measure that would force the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers, and all Union/State (and NCT of Delhi) ministers to demit office if they remain <strong>in custody for 30 consecutive days</strong> in connection with an offence punishable with <strong>imprisonment of five years or more</strong>. The Lok Sabha has <strong>referred the Bill to a Joint Parliamentary Committee</strong> (JPC) for scrutiny. (Source:&nbsp;<a href='https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2025/Constitution_%28130th_Amendment%29_Bill%2C2025.pdf' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>PRS Legislative Research</a>)</p>  <h2>What the Bill changes (in plain terms)</h2>  <ul> <li><strong>Who is covered:&nbsp;</strong>The Prime Minister and Union ministers (Article 75), Chief Ministers and State ministers (Article 164), and the Council of Ministers for the <strong>NCT of Delhi</strong> (Article 239AA). (Source:&nbsp;<a href='https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2025/Constitution_%28130th_Amendment%29_Bill%2C2025.pdf' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>PRS Legislative Research</a>)</li> <li><strong>The 30-day custody trigger:&nbsp;</strong>If a covered office-holder is <strong>detained in custody for at least 30 consecutive days</strong> for an offence <strong>punishable with a term that may extend to five years or more</strong>, removal is triggered. (Source:&nbsp;<a href='https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2025/Constitution_%28130th_Amendment%29_Bill%2C2025.pdf' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>PRS Legislative Research</a>)</li> <li><strong>How removal happens:&nbsp;</strong>For <strong>ministers</strong>, the constitutional head (President/Governor) <strong>must remove them on the advice</strong> of the Prime Minister/Chief Minister; <strong>if such advice is not given by Day 31, the minister automatically ceases to hold office</strong>. For the <strong>Prime Minister/Chief Minister</strong>, they must <strong>resign by Day 31</strong> or they <strong>cease to hold office automatically</strong>. (Source:&nbsp;<a href='https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2025/Constitution_%28130th_Amendment%29_Bill%2C2025.pdf' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>PRS Legislative Research</a>)</li> <li><strong>Return to office after release:&nbsp;</strong>The text also provides that the affected person <strong>may be re-appointed on release from custody</strong> (i.e., once not in custody). <em>(Note: the Bill&rsquo;s text uses &ldquo;release from custody&rdquo;; the government&rsquo;s public note frames this as reinstatement on obtaining bail. &ldquo;Bail within 30 days&rdquo; is not a phrase in the Bill itself.)</em> (Source:&nbsp;<a href='https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2025/Constitution_%28130th_Amendment%29_Bill%2C2025.pdf' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>PRS Legislative Research</a>)</li> </ul>  <h2>What it does <strong>not</strong> do</h2>  <ul> <li>It <strong>does not require a criminal conviction</strong> to trigger loss of office; the threshold is <strong>30 days&rsquo; continuous custody</strong> for offences with a potential sentence of <strong>five years or more</strong>. This is a higher bar than mere arrest, but lower than conviction. (Source:&nbsp;<a href='https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2025/Constitution_%28130th_Amendment%29_Bill%2C2025.pdf' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>PRS Legislative Research</a>)</li> <li>It <strong>does not alter disqualification rules for MPs/MLAs</strong> under the Representation of the People Act; it creates a <strong>constitutional rule specific to holding executive office</strong> (PM/CM/minister), separate from legislative membership. <em>(This follows from the placement of the new clauses in Articles 75/164/239AA.)</em> (Source:&nbsp;<a href='https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2025/Constitution_%28130th_Amendment%29_Bill%2C2025.pdf' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>PRS Legislative Research</a>)</li> </ul>  <h2>Why the government says this is needed</h2>  <p>The <strong>Statement of Objects and Reasons</strong> (signed by Home Minister Amit Shah) says the measure aims to <strong>safeguard and enhance public probity</strong> by ensuring that persons under prolonged custody for serious offences do not continue in executive office. The government&rsquo;s public brief additionally pitches it as &ldquo;clean governance&rdquo; reform.</p>  <h2>Key debates to watch</h2>  <ul> <li><strong>Scope and misuse risks:</strong> Critics argue a prolonged-custody trigger could be <strong>weaponised through arrest and bail delays</strong>, potentially unsettling elected executives without a conviction. Supporters answer that the <strong>30-day and &ldquo;5 years or more&rdquo; thresholds</strong> guard against frivolous cases and align with public expectations of integrity in high office. Expect the JPC to examine safeguards, definitions, and due-process concerns.</li> <li><strong>Delhi&rsquo;s special status:</strong> Extending the rule to <strong>Article 239AA (NCT of Delhi)</strong> ensures parity with States, but debate may arise over Centre&ndash;Delhi power balances in the wake of recent disputes.

(Source:&nbsp;<a href='https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2025/Constitution_%28130th_Amendment%29_Bill%2C2025.pdf' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>PRS Legislative Research</a>)</li> </ul>  <h2>Where the Bill stands now</h2>  <ul> <li><strong>Introduced in Lok Sabha and sent to a JPC</strong> on <strong>August 20, 2025</strong> for detailed examination; the House has asked the committee to report <strong>before the next session</strong>. (The committee size and composition were set by the Lok Sabha motion.)</li> <li>Next steps include JPC recommendations, consideration and passage by both Houses with the <strong>special majority</strong> required under <strong>Article 368</strong>. Some constitutional amendments additionally require <strong>ratification by at least half of the States</strong> if they touch subjects listed in the proviso to Article 368(2). The government has not publicly specified whether it will seek state ratification for this Bill; that assessment typically turns on whether the amendment alters matters enumerated in the proviso. (Source:&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India?utm_source=chatgpt.com' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>)</li> </ul>  <h2>Bottom line</h2>  <p>If enacted as introduced, the 130th Amendment would <strong>constitutionally bar</strong> the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers, and ministers from <strong>continuing in office while in 30+ days&rsquo; custody for serious offences</strong>, with <strong>automatic cessation</strong> if constitutional advice or resignation is not tendered by Day 31, and with a path to <strong>re-appointment after release</strong>. The measure has been <strong>sent to a Joint Parliamentary Committee</strong>, where the precise language&mdash;especially around the 30-day custody rule and re-appointment&mdash;will face close scrutiny before any final vote by Parliament (and any further steps, if required).</p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article,&nbsp;<a href='/articles/index.html'>read out articles for more such articles</a>.</p> </div>

I contribute to PeoplesBLOG to share honest takes on everything from gadgets and digital tools to social issues and everyday experiences.</p><p>I’m curious by nature, detail-driven, and someone who likes to question things that don’t sit right. When I’m not writing or coding, you’ll probably find me on a motorcycle trip or working on a side project.</p>
