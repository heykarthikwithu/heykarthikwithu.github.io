        Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers.
        They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it.'>

        <p>Ambedkar was born into a poor low Mahar (dalit) caste, who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.
        Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers.
        They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it.</p>

        <p>Also he has seen many such incidents in his life on the people discrimination and He fought for the rights.
        And Today we see him as A Economist, A Politician and A Social Reformer.</p>

        <p>As a common man, i feel sad that the fought made by Ambedkar to see all people under same page is not happening even in 2019.</p>
        <p>Say like, Still people will go for reservation..</p>
        <p>We, In Secular India, people should have not been taking reservations today, The system of reservation should have been gradually decreased from past 60 years. And this is why Ambedkar has fought for.</p>

        <p>Hope today's Indian people, will realise why Secularism is important in the Country. And move towards Secularism.</p>

        <p> - A Common Man</p>
